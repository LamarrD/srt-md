00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,525
So far, we have discussed how to find the enemy,

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:05,235
how to identify the enemy,

3
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,305
and even how to catch the enemy.

4
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:09,630
But now we come to a crucial question,

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,075
what do we do once they're caught?

6
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:15,330
It has been said, "Observe your enemies,

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,760
for the first find faults."

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,440
In this lesson, we are going to discuss the analysis of malware.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,775
We're going to find our weaknesses through the efforts of our enemies,

10
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:32,400
and then about the continued battle between malware analysis and malware obfuscation.
