1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,400
Since the malware contents
are encrypted, and

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,900
look random, a signature-based
approach would not work.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,460
Therefore, the first statement is true.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,670
And, since the malware contents
are encrypted, and look different,

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,870
there's no single signature
that matches all the instances.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,070
So, the second statement is false.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,640
Of course, we need to include code that
decrypts the malware in runtime so

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,330
that the malware can execute.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,900
Therefore, the first statement is true.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,930
Know that we can simply use
the code that the compressed or

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,030
the encrypted malware as a signature
because legitimate programs

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,530
can contain such instructions, for
example for digital rights management.
