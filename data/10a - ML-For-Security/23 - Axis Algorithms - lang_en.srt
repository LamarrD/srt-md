1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,165
An axis attribute is typically the most important attribute,

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:04,695
for example, the service.

3
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:08,080
An association must contain an axis attribute.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,410
Therefore, we can eliminate patterns that

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,785
describe associations among non-essential attributes.

6
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:16,980
Once we compute associations involving axis attributes,

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,645
then we can compute sequential patterns involving these associations,

8
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,250
and that's how we compute sequential patterns.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,330
Here's an example. We use service as the axis attribute,

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,965
then we can compute a number of associations.

11
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:34,445
For example, there's frequent association of S zero and http.

12
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:39,245
We then use reference attribute to compute a sequence of related associations.

13
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:42,500
These associations in a sequence all refer to the same reference

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,150
subject because they are essentially a sequence of related actions.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,245
For example, in this sequential pattern,

16
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:51,700
all associations are referring to the same destination host.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,600
Again, the reference attribute can be used as a constraint to filter out patterns,

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,840
that are not useful for intrusion detection.
