1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
The first one, the main task is to find patterns,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,120
structures or knowledge in unlabeled data

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,410
that is unsupervised because the data is not labeled.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,245
That is the machine learning algorithm is not told which label belongs to which data.

5
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:19,360
Second, the task is to find the function or model that explains the data.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,280
This is supervised because the data is labeled and machine-learning is

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,510
going to produce a function that model the relationship between the data and its label.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,130
Third, some of the data is labeled during acquisition.

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,830
This is semi-supervised.
