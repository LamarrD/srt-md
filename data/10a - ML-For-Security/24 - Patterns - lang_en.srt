1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
After we compute the frequent patterns from the normal data and from the intrusion data,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,250
we can then compare and identify the unique patterns that are from the intrusion data.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,605
We can then use these patterns to construct futures to build classifiers.

4
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:18,030
We call the axis and reference attributes the anatomy of an attack and

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,980
the emergence attributes are those that are

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,890
independent of the axis and reference attributes.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,070
Since our patterns are frequent and sequential in nature,

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,875
we apply these operators to add the corresponding,

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,240
temporal and statistical features.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,470
To summarize, we mind patterns from

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,085
both the intrusion and a normal datasets and compare the patterns.

12
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:41,390
We identify the patterns associated with only the intrusion dataset.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,280
We construct futures according to

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,805
these patterns and add these features into the training dataset.

15
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:48,620
We can then apply a machine

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,270
learning algorithm to learn a classifier that can detect intrusions.
