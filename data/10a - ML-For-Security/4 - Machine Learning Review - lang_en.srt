00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
Let's have a quick overview of machine learning.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,335
The task of machine learning is that,

3
00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:10,260
given training examples, we would learn a function that can predict the output.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,140
Then, once we learn this function,

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,075
we can apply it to testing examples and this function can then produce the output.

6
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:21,830
For example, the input can be fruits and the output can be the names of the fruits.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,410
For example, is it an apple or orange?

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,870
A partition function will be able to analyze the features of

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,960
these fruits and determine whether it is apple versus orange.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,675
The first step in machine learning is training.

11
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:39,520
Here, the Xs are the examples and the Ys are the labels of these examples.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,845
Then, the machine learning algorithm is going to produce

13
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:47,900
the best possible function by minimizing the prediction error on this training data set.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,025
We're going to discuss a few example machine learning algorithms.

15
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:55,280
In a testing phase, we apply the learned function to a set

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,460
of test data which was not used in training,

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,155
and the function should be able to produce predicted value of Y given X.

18
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:07,490
Ideally, data used in machine learning should reflect the real world.

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,250
Therefore, we use a process to draw data from the real-world application.

20
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,155
Then, that data is randomly split into a training data set and test data set.

21
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:20,060
We can then apply a machine learning algorithm to

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,170
a training data to learn the particular function that can be applied to test dataset.
