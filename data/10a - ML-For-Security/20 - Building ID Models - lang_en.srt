00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
Here's a high level overview of this process.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,385
We start with raw audit data.

3
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:05,930
For example, packets.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,300
We summarize data into connection records.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,290
Then we find frequent patterns,

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,090
and then we compare the patterns to

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,165
determine the unique patterns associated with intuitions.

8
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:18,065
We then construct features according to these patterns.

9
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:20,940
With these features, we can learn classification models.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,830
This process is iterative.

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,100
In fact, each step can iterate it over and over to improve performance.
