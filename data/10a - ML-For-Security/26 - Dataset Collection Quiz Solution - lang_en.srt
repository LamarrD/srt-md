00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,690
First, we should recognize that,

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,930
there's no perfect way of labeling data and

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,700
therefore there's really no perfect IDS dataset.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,240
What we can do, is select a baseline dataset for network.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,420
Then, also use a dataset,

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,630
that has a range of intuition examples.
