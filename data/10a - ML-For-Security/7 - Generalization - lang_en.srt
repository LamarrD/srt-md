00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,045
A good machine learning model should be able to generalize

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:06,415
from the data that it was trained on to new test data set.

3
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:10,755
That is, we don't want to just learn the data from the training data set.

4
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,100
That is, given the objects in a training data set,

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,230
for example, the different apples here,

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,230
we want the machine learning algorithm to be able to learn the general characteristics of

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,510
the apples so that given an image of

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,590
apple that was not previously seen in the training data set,

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,810
the learned model is able to correctly predict that it is indeed an apple.

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,900
In short, generalization is the most important property of machine learning.
