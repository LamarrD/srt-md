00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,570
Now, let's discuss how do we find patterns.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,560
We use data mining algorithms to find patterns.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,390
We first find the associations among the features.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,780
For example, this association tells us that there are a lot of S0 HTTP connections.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,930
We then find the patterns that describe how

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,615
the associations tend to appear in a sequence.

7
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,450
For example, this pattern says that,

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,690
if you see the first two,

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,265
there's 80 percent chance that you will see the third one,

10
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:26,870
and all these are within a two second terminal.
