1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,065
The basic algorithms are the association rules and frequent episodes.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:07,245
These algorithms can produce many useless patterns.

3
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:10,890
For example, these algorithms can produce associations

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,865
and frequent sequences involving source bytes and destination bytes.

5
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:18,040
These patterns are not useful for intrusion detection.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,140
The reason is that, these patterns don't even involve

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,335
more important attributes such as a service and the flag.

8
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:27,135
Therefore, we modify the basic algorithms,

9
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:30,370
so that they only produce relevant or useful patterns.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,615
The intuition is that,

11
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,840
development patterns must describe these essential features.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,770
More specifically, we use some of

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,590
these essential features as a so-called axis attributes,

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,440
or reference attributes, to constrain how the patterns can be computed.
