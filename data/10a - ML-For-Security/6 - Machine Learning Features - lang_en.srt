00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
The features using machine learning are very much application-dependent.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,880
For images, these are useful features: the raw pixels,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,825
the histogram, and GIST,

4
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:13,070
which is a representation of the scene, and so on.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,790
We are going to discuss features useful for network monitoring later.
