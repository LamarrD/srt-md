1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,865
Clustering can also be used for classification.

2
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:05,445
In clustering, we assigned training examples

3
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:08,490
into different clusters based on some distance measure.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,100
That is examples in the same cluster are more

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,295
similar to each other than examples from different clusters.

6
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:18,180
Typically, we defined some distance function to measure similarity.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,740
Here's an overview of the clustering process.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,705
Typically, we predetermine the number of clusters.

9
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:25,935
We also start with seed clusters,

10
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:27,510
each with one element.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,480
That is, each seed is a representative example of a cluster.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,590
They may assign a samples to these C clusters based on distance measures,

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,160
then we adjust or find a new centroids.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,130
A centroid is the center of the cluster according to distance measure.

15
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,720
Then based on the new centroids,

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,325
we are just cluster membership,

17
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,580
so the examples are assigned to the best fit clusters.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,845
The example here belong to this cluster because

19
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,415
it is closer to the centroid than to the centroid and that centroid.

20
00:00:55,415 --> 00:01:00,130
In other words, cluster membership is based on distance to the centroid of the cluster.

21
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,885
We continue this process of finding new centroids and adjusting cluster membership,

22
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:06,760
until the customers converge.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,770
That is, there's no more changes in the cluster membership.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,900
Once the clusters are finalized,

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,810
then each cluster can be represented by its centroid.

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,540
Given a test data, it is assigned to a cluster

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,390
if its distance to the centroid is the shortest.
