00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,490
Now, let's discuss an evaluation of our approach.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,975
We use the darpa evolution dataset.

3
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:11,700
There are 38 attack types in the data and these attack types are in four categories,

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,795
denial service, probing, remote to local,

5
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:16,285
and user to root.

6
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:19,515
In particular, remote to local means that gaining

7
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:23,995
local axis and user to root means that gaining superuser privilege.

8
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:26,805
In this evaluation, training dataset is provided

9
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:30,105
but 40 percent of the attack types are only in test data.

10
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:33,790
That is these attack types are new to the intrusion detection systems.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,815
Here are the features that we defined and constructed for each connection record.

12
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:40,350
The intrinsic features such as protocol,

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,935
duration and flag, these are the ones that are inherent to any connection.

14
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:49,325
In other words, they can be used for many applications not just intrusion detection.

15
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:52,570
We construct a feature for the purpose of intrusion detection.

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,960
The content features are based on analysis of the payload.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,210
For example, we can tell how many failed login attempts.

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,735
Whether the login was successful or not,

19
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:03,200
number of root shells,

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,405
whether a su root has been attempted,

21
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:08,550
number of access to security control files and so on.

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,625
We compute a frequent patterns from the connection record and

23
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:15,365
then we construct temporal and statistical features accordingly.

24
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:18,905
These include number of connections to the same destination host

25
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:22,585
as the current connection in the past two seconds and among these connections,

26
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:24,285
number of rejected connections,

27
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,540
number of connections with syn errors,

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,120
number of different services,

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,070
percentage of connections they have the same service,

30
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,800
percentage of different or unique services,

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,540
and number of connections they have

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,955
the same service as the current connection and among these connections,

33
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:40,350
number of rejected conditions,

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,600
number of connections with syn errors,

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,115
number of different destination hosts,

36
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:48,000
percentage of connections they have the same destination host,

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,095
percentage of different or unique designation hosts.

38
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:55,605
Here we showed examples of the values of content features interconnection record.

39
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:59,270
We also label each connection as normal or one of the attacks.

40
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,390
Here is some example rules produced by machine learning.

41
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,510
For example, a buffer overflow attack can be detected

42
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,780
because there are a number of indicators of compromise.

43
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,670
A root shell has to be attained and su root has not be attempted.

44
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,945
Here we show examples of the values of traffic features.

45
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:20,360
Again, each connection record is labeled as normal or one of the attacks,

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,430
and here are some example rules produced by machine learning.

47
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,475
For example, in a smurf attack

48
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:30,080
ICMP echo request has been sent to the same service on the same host.

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,750
Satan is a probing attack and therefore there are

50
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,730
many different ports or services being probed and since many of them are closed,

51
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,940
many connection attempts are rejected.
