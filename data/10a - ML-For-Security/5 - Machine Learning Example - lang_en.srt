00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
Here is an example of machine learning.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,315
Suppose you want to learn the name or predict the name of an object,

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:07,590
for machine learning purpose,

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,435
these objects are represented as feature vectors of their images.

5
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:14,185
For example, apple, tomato, and cow,

6
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:16,625
they're all represented as feature vectors,

7
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:21,820
and then our function based on these feature vectors can predict the type of the object.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,030
So, let's go over the steps in this machine learning example.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,550
We start with the images of these objects,

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,810
we then make exact features from these images so that

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,250
each of these objects now is represented as a feature vector.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,080
Of course, we put the correct label to each object.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,200
For example, all these are apples,

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,340
all these are pears, and so on.

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,649
Then, once we have the objects represented as feature vectors with their labels,

16
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:49,335
then we can apply machine learning algorithm to chain a predictive function.

17
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:52,175
This predictive function is the learned model.

18
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:56,000
In testing, again, we start with the image of an object,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,100
we extract the same set of image features as in chaining.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,820
That is, now the object is represented as a feature vector.

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,910
We then apply the learned model into this feature vector.

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,540
The learned model which is a predictive function is

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,290
going to tell us the prediction or the type of this object.
