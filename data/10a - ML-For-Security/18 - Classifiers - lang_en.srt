1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,489
As a way to summarize,

2
00:00:01,489 --> 00:00:04,060
classifiers are very useful to many applications,

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,215
including security applications, such as intrusion detection.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,140
However, we should be reminded that,

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,340
machine learning algorithms are just tools.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,450
Therefore, we need to use them carefully.

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,015
We should always try simple classifiers first.

8
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,570
Most specifically, it is more important to have

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,930
small features than complicated or smart classifiers.

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,930
The reason is that, smart features,

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,340
capture the domain knowledge.

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,380
This is the key to producing effective classifiers.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,100
On the other hand, if we have a lot of data or wide variety of data,

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,460
we can use more powerful classifiers.

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,345
The problem of intrusion detection,

16
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:38,925
can be considered as, a classification problem.

17
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:41,095
Suppose, we are monitoring network traffic.

18
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:44,955
The traffic can contain normal traffic and various types of attack traffic.

19
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:47,665
The process of intrusion detection, is to determine,

20
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,430
among this set of all traffic,

21
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,050
which ones are normal,

22
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,000
which ones belong to different types of attacks.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,995
In other words, intrusion detection,

24
00:00:55,995 --> 00:01:00,480
is about classifying each number flow into normal or different attack types.

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,845
Therefore, it is natural to think that,

26
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,860
we can apply machine learning algorithm,

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,270
to learn a classifier, to detect intrusions.

28
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,430
That is, given a traffic data which has higher entropy,

29
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,580
because it is mixed with intrusions and normal traffic.

30
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,470
Our goal is to partition the data into subsets that each has a pure class.

31
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,015
Either normal or one of the attack types.

32
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,250
As we have discussed in decision tree,

33
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,080
we need to use features that has high information gain,

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,890
in this process of partitioning the original data set into subsets of pure classes.

35
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,995
So, that's the high level intuition,

36
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,335
of applying machine learning,

37
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:35,300
to the problem of intrusion detection.

38
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,550
Now let's discuss some details.
