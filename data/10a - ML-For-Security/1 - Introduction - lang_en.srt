00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
In this lesson, we will review machine learning,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,835
then use it to determine if a network flow is benign anomaly or adversarial.

3
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:12,840
The goal of applying machine learning to intrusion and detection is to

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,175
be able to automatically and quickly identify new attacks.

5
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:19,950
The earlier we can detect bad behavior,

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,340
the faster we can stop it.
