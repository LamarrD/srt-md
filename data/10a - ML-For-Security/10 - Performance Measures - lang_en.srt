00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
Now, let's discuss some of the key performance metrics of machine learning.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,740
The error rate is the fraction of false predictions.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,545
Accuracy is the fraction of correct predictions.

4
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:11,340
Precision is a fraction of

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,855
correct predictions among all examples predicted to be positive.

6
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:19,585
Recall is the fraction of correct predictions among all real positive examples.

7
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:24,685
Precision and recall are not limited to two class or positive versus negative problems.

8
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:28,580
That is, they can be generalized into multi-class applications.
