00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
Many machine learning applications or classification problems,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,640
that is the training data set contains

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,900
records with attributes or features and class labels.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,450
Then, the machine learning algorithm is to produce a model that

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,395
would output the class label based on a set of attributes or features.

6
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:17,700
Once we have this model,

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,220
we can then use it to classify future data.
