1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
The first one, model normal network and

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,880
system behavior and identify deviations from the norm.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,810
This is anomaly detection.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,075
Second, combination of misuse and anomaly detection,

5
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:14,920
this is hybrid detection.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,645
The third one, detect known attacks using signatures of those attacks,

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,550
this is misused detection.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,150
The forth one, can detect known types of

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,680
attacks without generating a lot of false positives,

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,390
this is misuse detection.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,270
The last one, have the ability to detect zero-day attacks,

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,180
this is anomaly detection.
