1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,515
Now, let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:03,930
The context is applying machine learning to

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,330
the problem of detecting bonded command control.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,240
Supposed we decide to use supervised learning,

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,160
that means data should be labeled,

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,090
and we want a high percentage of network flows to be correctly classified.

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,320
The question is which type of data do we need for C&C Protocol Detection?
