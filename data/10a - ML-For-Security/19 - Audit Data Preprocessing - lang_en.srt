1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,785
We start with raw data captured from the network tab,

2
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:04,535
for example, your pickup data.

3
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:05,800
From the pickup data,

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,835
we can summarize the data into connection records.

5
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:10,955
Each record has a set of attributes,

6
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:13,700
for example, time stamp, duration,

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,080
source IP, destination IP,

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,035
number of bytes, the service,

9
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:19,695
and the flag, and so on.

10
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:24,155
For example, SF means the connection has gone through both SYN and FIN,

11
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:27,700
and REJ means that the connection request has been rejected.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,275
As we have discussed earlier,

13
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:33,680
having small features is the key to building effective classification models.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,360
This is known as the feature construction problem.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,335
In the context of intrusion detection,

16
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:41,820
the attributes or features of the connection records are not very useful.

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,775
For example, if you look at SYN flag,

18
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,910
that means, we only see the initial SYN packet.

19
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,485
Of course, with SYN flag,

20
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:51,495
we'll see a lot of connection attempts with SYN flag.

21
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:55,310
Of course, normal data can also have this S0 flag,

22
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,620
for example, because the connection request or response is lost.

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,940
That is, by looking at the feature flag,

24
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,180
it is not sufficient to detect intrusion.

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,600
On the other hand, if you look at the percentage of

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,100
S0 flag connections to particular host,

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,100
then we can see that this feature can distinguish intrusion from normal.

28
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,070
In other words, this feature has high information gain.

29
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,155
The problem is that this feature is not in the original feature set,

30
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:22,835
which means we need to construct features that have high information gains.

31
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:26,885
So, the question is how do we construct features that have high information gains?

32
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:31,280
That is, features that are useful to distinguish normal versus intrusions.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,005
Our approach is to use temporal and statistical patterns associated with intrusions,

34
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:40,670
for example, a lot of S0 connections to the same service and host,

35
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,155
within a short period of time.

36
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:45,040
This pattern is associated with SYN flag.

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,465
Once we have these patterns,

38
00:01:46,465 --> 00:01:51,130
we can then construct features accordingly that can be used to detect these intrusions.
