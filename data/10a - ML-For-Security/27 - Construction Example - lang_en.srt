00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Let's consider an example of feature construction.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,095
Suppose here's the set of connection records associated with syn flood.

3
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:11,705
Using service as the access attribute and destination host as a reference attribute,

4
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:13,800
we can compute a frequent pattern.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,910
Based on this pattern, we can construct these following features,

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,935
count the connections to the same destination host in the past two seconds,

7
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:22,590
and among these connections,

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,615
the percentage with the same service,

9
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:27,210
and the percentage that has the S0 flag.
