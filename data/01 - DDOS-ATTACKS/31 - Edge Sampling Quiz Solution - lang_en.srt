1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,830
With edge sampling,
multiple sources can be identified.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,950
Therefore, multiple
attackers can be identified.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,440
As we can see, it's relatively easy for

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,060
a victim to reconstruct a path
given the edge information.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,310
So this second statement is false.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,720
The edge information is stored
in the IP packet header, so

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,790
therefore, the third statement is true.
