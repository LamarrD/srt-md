00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,260
Now let's discuss network denial of
service attack in some more details.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,520
The goal of network denial of service
attack is to take out a large site

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,820
such as a web server with as little
computing power as possible.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,490
So how is network denial
of service accomplished?

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,230
One of the main approaches
is amplification.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,880
This means that the attacker only needs
to send a small number of packets and

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,880
can achieve a big effect such as
rendering the targeted site unavailable.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,870
There are two types of
amplification attacks.

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,650
The first type is to exploit a bug or
vulnerability on the server.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,804
For example, if there's a design flaw or
implementation error on the server code,

11
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:45,997
then the attacker machine
can send a few packets that

12
00:00:45,997 --> 00:00:50,155
contain input that would trigger
the bug and then crash the server.

13
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:52,973
And of course,
when the server program is crashed,

14
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:55,530
then the server become unavailable.

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,840
Another type of denial of service
attack is to send a flood of packets.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,820
For example,

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,580
an attacker can use a large botnet to
send a lot of requests to the server.

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,400
Network denial of service attack
can happen at any network layer.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,220
As a quick review, there are multiple
layers in a network stack.

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,720
For example, denial of service
attack can happen at the link layer.

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,660
This means that the attacker
simply sends a lot of traffic

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,250
to saturate the link.

23
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,550
Denial of service attack can happen at
a TCP/UDP layer or the transport layer.

24
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,560
For example,

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,180
the server needs to use memory to
hold the state of TCP connections, so

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,170
the attacker can send a lot of TCP
packets to exhaust the server's memory.

27
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,870
Denial of service attack can also
happen at the application layer.

28
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,450
For example, the attacker can
request the server application

29
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,780
to fetch a large amount of data.

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,840
And if there are many such requests, the
server's resources will be exhausted.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,450
The sad truth is that
the current Internet design

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,040
cannot handle distributed
denial of service attacks.
