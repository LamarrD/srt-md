00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,940
Let's discuss another
mitigation technique.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,830
You may be already familiar with this.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,150
It is called CAPTCHA, which stands for

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:13,140
Completely Automated Public Turing test
to tell Computers and Humans Apart.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,240
The idea is that the server should
verify that the connection is from

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,820
a human instead of, for example,
from a bot or a malware.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,970
So I'm sure many of you
are familiar with this.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,480
The idea is that only human
can interpret this figure and

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,790
then type in the actual words.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,385
During a denial of service attack,
the server can generate CAPTCHAs and

11
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:40,755
process request only if the client

12
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:44,535
presents the actual valid solution
to the CAPTCHA challenge.

13
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:48,015
Because that will prove that there's
actual human behind the request.
