1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,140
Client puzzles should not be hard for
a server to construct, so this is false.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,370
Client puzzles should be stateless,
this will keep a client

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,230
from being able to guess the puzzle and
find a solution before even being asked.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,900
Puzzle complexity should increase
as the attack volume increases.
