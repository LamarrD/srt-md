1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,660
Now let's take a look at the network
protocols to understand why the internet

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,520
is vulnerable to DoS service attacks.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,980
So the internet protocol or
IP is connectionless.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,620
This means that it is not reliable,

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,140
meaning that each packet will find it's
way to destination and there is no

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,940
mechanism to ensure that all packets
will arrive properly and in sequence

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,340
at least not at IP layer essentially
it is the best effort delivery.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,409
So here is the format of the IP header
for the purpose of our discussion

9
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,340
let's focus on a source IP address and
a destination IP address.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,840
>From the security point of
view the main weakness of IP

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,880
is that there is no authentication
of the source IP address.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,940
Which means that the attacker
can spoof an IP source address.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,060
Now let's take a look at TCP.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,480
TCP is session based which
means the destination is going

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,330
to make sure that all packets belonging
to a same connection will arrive and

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,540
properly sequence.

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,040
And in order to achieve this
there's congestion control and

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,890
in order delivery mechanisms.

19
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,000
These mechanisms ensure
that the data loss or

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,810
packet loss is minimized and the need to
retransmit packets is also minimized.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,190
And here's the format of the TCP header.

22
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,750
Notice that we use a sequence number for
each packet.

23
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,070
Acknowledgement number to
acknowledge a packet as received.

24
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,400
And number flags to actually
keep the state of the session.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,420
Now let's take a look
at TCP handshake or

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,340
the steps to establish a TCP connection.

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,575
Suppose our client wants
to connect to a server.

28
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:41,380
It first sends a SYN packet,
this packet has a SYN flag set and

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,360
also a sequence number.

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,020
The acknowledgement number is 0
because this is the first packet.

31
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,710
The server responds
with a SYN/ACK packet,

32
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,450
which means that both the SYN flap and
the ACK flags are set.

33
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,060
The sequence number is
a server sequence number and

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,120
acknowledgment number is
the sequence number plus one.

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,800
This means that this SYN/ACK
packet is an acknowledgement

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,380
of the initial SYN
packet from the client.

37
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,050
And then the client sends a final
ACK packet to the server.

38
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,840
In this ACK packet, it incremented
its Its own sequence number and

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,490
acknowledge the sequence
number from the server.

40
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,480
This tells the server that the client
has received this SYN/ACK packet.

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,370
At this point,
the TCP connection is established.
