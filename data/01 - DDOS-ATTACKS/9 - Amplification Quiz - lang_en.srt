1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,640
Now let's go over an application
example and then do a quiz.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,150
One example of attacks is to use
the NTP, Network Time Protocol.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,950
This protocol is used to
synchronize machines to the clocks.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,670
For example on a Mac, the day and time
are set by an NTP server run by Apple.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,410
When a computer request
the time from the NTP server,

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,620
the server responds with
the correct time and date.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,570
In NTP, the data volume of
the request from a machine

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,580
is much smaller than
the response from the server.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,520
Now you can imagine how NTP can be
used for the now service attack.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,910
So with that background,
let's do a quiz.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:46,130
Which of these are reasons why
the UDP-based NTP protocol

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,510
is particularly vulnerable
to amplification attacks?
