1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,930
For random scanning,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,770
it means that each compromised
computer probes random addresses.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,160
For permutation scanning,
all compromised computers

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,200
share a common pseudo-random
permutation of the IP address space.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,030
Signpost scanning uses
the communication patterns

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,740
of the compromised computer
to find new target.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,057
In hitlist scanning,

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:28,090
a portion of a list of targets is
supplied to a compromised computer.
