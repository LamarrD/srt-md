1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,120
SYN cookies does not require modified
version of TCP, so this is false.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,230
SYN cookies are only applied
when there's a SYN flood attack.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,530
That is, during normal operations,
or when a server does not experience

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,550
a overload,
it does not require SYN cookies.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,550
Therefore, SYN cookies should not
lead to overall slower performance,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,980
that is the second statement is false.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,130
The third statement is true
because during an attack,

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,400
the server uses SYN cookies and does
not keep stay information in memory.
