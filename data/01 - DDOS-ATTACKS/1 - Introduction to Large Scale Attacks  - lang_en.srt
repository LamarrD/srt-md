1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,930
We begin our discussion
of network security

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,750
with an attack that all
of us are familiar with.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,220
Large scale attacks.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,690
Specifically, distributed
denial of service attacks, and

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,870
malware based attacks.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,370
We will discuss the methods used and

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,920
the security weaknesses that
are exploited in these attacks.
