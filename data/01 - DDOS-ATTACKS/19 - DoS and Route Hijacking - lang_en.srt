1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,770
The Internet routing protocol
can also be exploited to

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,830
launch in our service attacks.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,910
In particular,
there have been several incidents of

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,050
route hijacking that resulted
in denial of service.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,750
Here's one example involving
Pakistan and YouTube.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,940
The Internet is divided into a large
number of so-called autonomous systems.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,410
Each autonomous system or
AS is responsible for

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,480
logging packets in and out a subset of
the Internet defined by the prefix.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,280
For example, the YouTube service
address is within this prefix.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,618
It is actually 208.65.103.238.

11
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:44,545
In February 2008, Pakistan Telecom
advertise that, is actually

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:49,990
responsible for subset of Internet
defined by this particular prefix.

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,490
And this prefix is more specific

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,450
than a segment that includes
the YouTube server.

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,340
And since the routing positions for
a specific IP address,

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,440
such as the YouTube server
use the more specific prefix.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,960
Then the whole Internet thought that
Pakistan Telecom is responsible for

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,630
routing traffic to YouTube.

19
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,370
The result of this
route hijacking is that

20
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,450
all traffic to YouTube was
instantly routed to Pakistan.

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,680
As you can see,
the traffic volume at the YouTube server

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,130
jumped to zero until the route
hijacking mistake was corrected.

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,552
In a more recent example,
China Telecom published

24
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:34,420
BGP routes that caused .mail and
.gov to route through China Telecom.
