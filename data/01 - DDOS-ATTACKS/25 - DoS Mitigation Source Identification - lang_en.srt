1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,070
Another important mitigation
is source identification.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,310
The goal is to identify
the source of attack packets so

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,080
that ultimately we can block
the attack at each source.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,020
You may think that this problem
should be easy because, for example,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,730
we discussed that many of the packets
involved a denial of service attacks,

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,920
they have spoof or
random source IP addresses.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,740
So the question is, why don't we
just ask the ISPs to filter out

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,159
source IP addresses that are not
legitimate or valid for the ISP?

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,130
For example,

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,360
if the router expects that all traffic
is from this particular prefix, then

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,680
it can drop all packets with a source
IP address other than from this prefix.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,580
That way smooth packets can be dropped.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,240
The biggest problem for this proposal is
that it requires all ISPs to do this.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,400
Because, as we will show, if only 10%
of ISPs do not implement, then there's

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,740
actually no defense against denial
of service for the whole Internet.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,030
Then the problem becomes that
every ISP is waiting for

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,820
everyone else to implement this first.

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,500
As we have shown in
the previous example,

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,570
if only 3 ISPs do not
implement ingress filtering,

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,140
the attackers can already launch
a big denial of service attack.

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,200
As of 2014,

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,610
a quarter of the autonomous systems
are mostly ISPs or big enterprises.

23
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,990
They do not implement ingress filtering.

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:32,070
In total, that means 13% of
the IP addresses can be spoofed.
