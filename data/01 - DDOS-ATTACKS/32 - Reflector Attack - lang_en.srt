1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,959
Let's discuss a more recent type
of denial-of-service attack called

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,670
reflector attack.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,270
So here, the attacker spoofed
the victim's source IP address and

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,840
sends DNS query to many DNS servers.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,600
And all DNS servers will
respond to this query and

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,340
send their response to
the victim machine.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,500
And, of course, the result is
that the victim is flooded.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,770
In addition to DNS example,

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,790
there are other examples that use
web servers and Gnutella servers.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,434
A reflector attack is typically
launched by a bot master.

11
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:40,310
Commanding many bots, each of them
will send a lot of requests to many

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,420
reflectors, such as DNS servers,
web servers and the Gnutella servers.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,810
And these requests will spoof
the victim IP address and

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,520
as a result, the reflectors will
send the response to the victim.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,870
Since the actual flooding traffic is
from the reflectors to the victim,

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,856
a traceback scheme will trace the attack
packets back to the reflectors.

17
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:07,901
And the reflectors may not do any
marking or keep any state, so

18
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,770
there's no traceback from the reflector
back to the bots or bot master.
