00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,490
Now let's do a quiz
relates to web attacks.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,820
According to the OWASP in 2013,

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,420
the following are the top
10 attacks on web security.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,840
I would like you to rank them in order,
1 for the most common and 10 for

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,340
the least common.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,970
These attacks are,
security misconfiguration,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,630
insecure direct object references,
missing function level access control,

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,390
sensitive data exposure, using
components with known vulnerabilities,

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,650
cross site scripting,
unvalidated redirects and forwards,

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:44,380
broken authentication and session,
injection, cross site request forgery.
