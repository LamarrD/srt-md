1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,260
The first three are allowed because they
have the same protocol, host and port.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,000
The fourth has a different port,
port 81, so it's not in the same origin.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,900
The fifth has a different host and
the sixth has a different protocol.
