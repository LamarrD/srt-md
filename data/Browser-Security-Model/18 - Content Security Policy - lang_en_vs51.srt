1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,460
Now let's discuss,
content security policy, or CSP.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,650
The goal of content security
policy to prevent or

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,260
at least limit the damage
of Course side scripting.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,966
Recall that we discussed course
side scripting attacks in CS

5
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:21,608
6035: Introduction to
Information Security.

6
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:24,350
Essentially a course
side scripting attack

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,590
bypasses the same origin policy by
tricking a site into delivering

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,580
some malicious code along
with the intended content.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,800
For example,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,930
a website is setup to echo the user
input as a web page back to a browser.

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,470
Such as echoing the user's name.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,810
But if the user input
contains malicious code,

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,380
then the website will be sending
malicious code to a web browser.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,830
With CSP, the main idea is that
a browser can be instructed

15
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,590
to load resources only
from a white-list.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,680
CSP prohibits inline scripts
embedded in script tags,

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,040
inline event handlers,
JavaScript, and URLs, etc, and

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,980
also disables JavaScript eval,
new function and so on.

19
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,100
That means all the resources
that a browser will load

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,820
can be statically checked.

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,470
And again the resources are loaded
only from a white list.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,500
Since there are many different
types of web contents,

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,850
with CSP we can specify the white
list for each type of web contents.

24
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,490
The sources of web contents
can be specified and matched.

25
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,360
For example, they can be specified
by scheme such as HTTPS or

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,340
HTTP, host name,
then we match any origin on that host.

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,370
Or fully qualified URI such
as https://example.com:443.

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:02,560
You can also specify how to match
the sources listed on a white list,

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,660
such as, wildcards accepted,
none, or self, and so on.

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,886
You can even create exceptions or
allow inline JavaScripts or

31
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:15,731
allow eval functions.
