1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,830
And the answers are the first attack

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,990
using components with
known vulnerabilities.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,470
The description is uses
unpatched third party components

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,665
because unpatched third party
components have known vulnerabilities.

5
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:20,025
Second, missing function
level access control.

6
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:25,011
For this attack, the description
is privilege functionality is

7
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:29,281
hidden rather than enforced
through access controls.

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:34,450
Because the attacks here says it's
missing function level access control.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,730
The third attack
sensitive data exposure.

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,360
For that to work,
the description is this one.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,120
Abuses the lack of data encryption.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,850
The next attack security
misconfiguration.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,940
The description is exploits
misconfigured servers.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,480
The next attack insecure
direct object references.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,700
The description is that
the attacker can modify

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,250
file names because file names
are direct object references.

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,800
The next attack, cross site scripting.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,860
The description is,
inserts Javascript into trusted sites.

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,160
The next one,
broken authentication and session.

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,340
The description is, program flaws allow
bypass of authentication methods.

21
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,750
Because the attack here exploits
broken authentication and session.

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,960
The last one, injection,

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,800
the description is modifies back-end
statement through user input.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,930
In other words the attack action
is injected through user input.
