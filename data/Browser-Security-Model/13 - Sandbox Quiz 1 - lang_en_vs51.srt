1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,330
Sandboxes and virtual machines
are often confused with one another.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,840
Let's use this quiz to try and
set the record straight about the two.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,460
Next to each characteristic,
put an S for Sandbox, V for

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,090
virtual machine, and B for both.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,710
First, anything changed or created is
not visible beyond its boundaries.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,110
Second, if data is not saved,
it is lost when the application closes.

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,020
Third, it is a machine within a machine.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,840
Fourth, lightweight and easy to setup.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,760
Fifth, disk space must be
allocated to the application.
