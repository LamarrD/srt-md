1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,804
The first two are true.

2
00:00:01,804 --> 00:00:06,703
The first statement is false because
it is not widely supported by many

3
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:07,980
browsers.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,740
The fourth is also false because
the cross-origin resource sharing header

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,020
cannot be used as a substitute for
sound security.
