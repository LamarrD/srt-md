1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,895
The second statement is true
because you can certainly list

2
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:09,455
Google + as a trusted source and
list it in the white list.

3
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:13,500
For the first statement,
if you use third party software

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,030
that has inline script,
you can still embed it on your site.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,000
You can use script source and
style source to allow inline script.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,650
For the third statement, for

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,680
really secure site,
it is best to restrict everything.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,640
Then once you know which sources will
be used, add them to the whitelist.
