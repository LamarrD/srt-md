00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,040
We call that when a browser connects to
a site, the server sets the cookie for

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,840
the web browsing session.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,420
There are a number of attributes
that a server can set for a cookie.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,370
For example SameSite means that

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,670
do not send cookie on
a cross-site post request.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,500
Strict, means that never send
cookie on cross-site request.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,900
Therefore, they provide some sort of
cross-site request forgery defense.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,070
With HttpOnly, it tells the browser
that this particular cookie

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,320
should only be assessed by the server.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,400
Any attempt to assess the cookie
from script is strictly forbidden.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,000
This can provide defense against
cross-site scripting attacks.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,850
And the scope of the cookie
is determined by

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,520
the combination of domain and path.
