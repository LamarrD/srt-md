1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,840
Now let's do a quick review
quiz on cryptographic checksum.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,738
Check all the statements that are true.

3
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:11,543
First, cryptographic hash functions
that are not one-way are vulnerable to

4
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:13,290
preimage attacks.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,460
Second, a difficult hash function is one
that takes a long time to calculate.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,160
Third, a good cryptographic
hash function

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,210
should employ an avalanching effect.
