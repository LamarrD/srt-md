1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,400
Origin is defined by protocol,
domain, and port.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,460
So the same origin means the same
protocol, domain, and port.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,490
For document objects or DOM in
a browser, the same origin policy says

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:20,210
that origin A can access origin B's DOM
if A and B have the same origin.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,620
Meaning that they have the same
protocol, domain, and port.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,970
For cookies we say two
cookies have the same origin

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,120
if they have the same domain and path.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,900
The protocol is optional.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,560
We're going to discuss in more
detail the same origin policy for

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,510
cookies later.
