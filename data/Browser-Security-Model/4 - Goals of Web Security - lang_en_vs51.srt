00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,550
Now, let's discuss
the goals of web security.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,140
Obviously, we need to be able
to browse the web safely.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,450
This means that,
when browsing a website, sensitive data

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,980
on the user's computer can not be
stolen and uploaded to the web.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,020
And that if the web browser has multiple
open sessions with multiple sites.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,350
For example,
one session to a bank website, and

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,810
another session is to
a social network site.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,920
The sessions don't
interfere with each other.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,150
Intuitively, if the social
network site is compromised,

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,140
it should not affect the user
session with the bank site.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,210
In addition, we need to ensure that

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,030
the web applications can have
the same security protection,

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,160
as applications that run on
the operating system on our computers.
