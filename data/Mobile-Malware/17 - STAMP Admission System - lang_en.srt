00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,180
Now let's discuss a research system
designed to analyze mobile apps and

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,340
decide if the mobile apps meet
security and privacy requirements.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,100
The system is intended to be used
in an App Store to decide if an app

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,340
should be admitted.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,290
The system uses both static and

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,000
dynamic analysis approaches because
they have pros and cons of their own.
