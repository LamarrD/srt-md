00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,360
There are more than 30 types of sources.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,270
Here are some examples.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,290
There are more than ten types of sinks,
and here are some examples.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,340
Each pair of source and
sink is a flow type,

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,210
and there are close to 400 flow types.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,460
Here's an example of data flow
analysis on the Facebook app.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,170
The description of the app says that it
allows the user to synchronize contacts.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,600
And it says that Facebook does not allow
the export of phone numbers or emails.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,520
And the users can plug one or
all apps but there's no privacy policy.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,290
Here are the possible flows.

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,150
On the left, we have the sources.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,820
On the right, we have the sinks.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,680
That is potentially all resources
can go to all the sinks.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,945
>From the Facebook description,
we expect to see the state of flow for

15
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:44,410
sinking contacts.

16
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,460
However, the data flows
observed from the Facebook app

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,790
include additional flows
that lead to leakage.
