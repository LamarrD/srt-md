00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:03,920
Wikipedia says that a mobile
device must be mobile.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,388
Therefore, a smartphone
by itself is not mobile.

3
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:10,450
However, a smarthone held
by a person can be mobile

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,750
because it is a non mobile
device with a mobile host.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,841
These are examples of true mobile
devices because either myself can be

6
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:18,410
mobile.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,080
We are not going to use the strict
definition of mobile device.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,060
Instead, we're going to use
this common definition.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,290
That is a smartphone is a mobile device.
