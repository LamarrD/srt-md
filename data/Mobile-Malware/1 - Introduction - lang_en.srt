00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:12,135
We're now going to look at malware analysis for mobile devices.

00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:17,070
We have separated malware analysis into two lessons for two reasons.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,010
It's a large topic and

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,800
mobile devices have some special considerations with regards to malware.
