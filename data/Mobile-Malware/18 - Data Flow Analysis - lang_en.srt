00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,630
One of the most important
analysis is data flow analysis.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,160
Here's an example of data flow,
the source is location data and

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,300
the sink is SMS or
website on the internet.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,960
Data flow analysis can
be useful malware or

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,379
greyware analysis to find out
what information is being stolen.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,540
And based on the discoveries, we can
improve enterprise specific policies.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,400
Data flow analysis can be used
to check the external app

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,780
to make sure that there's
no API abuse or data theft.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,000
Data flows gathered from an app
can be used to inform users

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
about potential privacy implications.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,510
Data flow analysis can also be used to
discover abilities in applications.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,760
For example,
accepting data from untrusted sources.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,430
However, analyzing data flows
is a very challenging task.

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,560
For example, Android has more than three
million lines of very complex code.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,990
Performing data analysis on whole
system would take a long time, and

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,210
it's not practical.

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,990
And of course to be useful,
data flow analysis has to be accurate.

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,510
As we have just discussed,
analyzing a app in a context

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,840
of full Android is very expensive
because there is too much code involved.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,050
The STAMP approach is to abstract
the Android stack into models.

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,410
And these models include
the following information.

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,570
We are going to focus on data flows.
