1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,350
Some apps may appear to be
providing useful functions but

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,630
they secretly still uses
confidential information.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,930
These apps are considered malware.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,980
Here's an example of such malicious
apps and it was taken off the app store.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,030
But malicious apps may still
get on victims devices

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,572
even after it is taken
off the app store.

7
00:00:18,572 --> 00:00:22,490
One technique is to exploit the design
floor in Apple's DRM scheme.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,900
Apple allows users to purchase and
download iOS apps from their app store

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,920
through the iTunes client
running on their computers.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,530
They can then use their computers to
install the apps onto their iOS devices.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,700
The iOS devices will request
an authorization code for

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,430
each app installed to prove
the app was actually purchased.

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,130
In a FairPlay man in the middle attack,
attackers purchase an app

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,260
from the app store, then intercept and
save the authorization code.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,620
They then develop a program that
simulates the iTunes software, and

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,990
installs the software
on a victim's computer.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,560
And this fake iTunes software
can check the victim's

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,260
iOS devices to believe the app
was purchased by the victim.

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,830
Therefor the user can install apps
they never actually paid for, and

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,810
the attacker can install malicious
apps without the user's knowledge.

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,550
This attack continues to work even
after the malicious app is removed

22
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,210
from the app store.
