1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Recall in a double spending example.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,970
This is a valid transaction,

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,525
and we want more confirmation of this block.

4
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:11,265
The question is, can we reward nodes that extend from this transaction block?

5
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:13,575
We cannot simply rely on honesty.

6
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:16,875
In fact, we should use incentive to promote honesty.

7
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,740
Since we are dealing with bitcoin which has value,

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,550
we should be able to provide incentive to nodes that behave honestly.
