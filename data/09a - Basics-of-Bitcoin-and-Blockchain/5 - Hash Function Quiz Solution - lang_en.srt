1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Cryptographic hash functions do not have a key.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,780
Second, a major drawback of cryptographic functions is

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,055
that it is easy to find two messages that have the same hash value.

4
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:14,625
That is false. Third, cryptographic hash functions

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:18,000
are primarily used for message integrity. That is true.
