00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,165
Now, let's have a quick review of digital signatures.

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:07,950
What we want from signatures is that only the owner of the private key can sign,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,510
but anyone can modify because they can retrieve the owners public key.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,115
Further, a signature is tied to a particular document.

5
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:20,050
Let's review how digital signatures are created and verified.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,960
We have a private signing key and a public verification key.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,480
The key pair can be created by specifying the key size.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,290
Then, for particular message,

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,650
we can create a signature by essentially encrypting

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,380
the message using the private signing key.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,210
Given the message and the signature,

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,400
any person who has obtained the public key can verify the signature.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,590
The verification is performed by using

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,390
the public key to decrypt the signature and matching the result with the message.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,715
What are the requirements for signatures?

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,865
Obviously, a valid signatures can be verified,

17
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,430
and no one can forge a signature.

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,420
Public key cryptography guarantees that although anyone can know the public key,

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,730
but without the private key,

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,630
which is only known to the owner,

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,440
no one can forge a signature.
