00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
In Bitcoin, we use proof-of-work.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,750
To create a block, a no finds a nonce such that the hash of the nonce with

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,790
a hash pointer to the previous block and

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,415
all the transactions in this block is very small.

5
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:15,450
Specifically, this hash value has to be smaller than a target value.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,455
With this proof-of-work, if Alice has 100 times more computing power than Bob,

7
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:24,300
it doesn't mean that she always wins the race of finding this nonce.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,545
It means that she has about a 99 percent chance of winning.

9
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:30,950
In the long run, Bob can still create one percent of the blocks.
