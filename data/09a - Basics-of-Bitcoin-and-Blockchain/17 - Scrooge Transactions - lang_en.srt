1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,195
In Scrooge coin, there are two kinds of transactions: the first kind is CreateCoins.

2
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:09,645
In this example, a CreateCoins transaction creates multiple coins.

3
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:12,885
Each coin has a serial number within a transaction number.

4
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:14,750
Each transaction has an ID,

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,760
and each coin has a serial number within a transaction.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,470
Each coin has a value,

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,990
meaning it's worth a certain number of Scrooge coins and also recipient,

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,000
which is the recipient's public key.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,165
In this example, a CreateCoins transaction creates multiple coins.

10
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:32,430
A transaction has a transaction ID.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,425
Each coin has a serial number within a transaction.

12
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:37,595
Each coin has a value, that is,

13
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:40,350
it's worth a certain number of Scrooge coins,

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,050
and each coin has a recipient,

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,140
which is the public key of the recipient.

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,250
A Scrooge coin transaction is always valid by definition if it is signed by Scrooge.

17
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,440
The second kind of transaction is called PayCoins.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,345
It consumes some coins, that is,

19
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,500
destroy them and creates new coins of the same total value.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,800
The new coins might belong to different people,

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,610
that is, different public keys.

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,900
This transaction has to be signed by everyone who's paying in a coin,

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,360
that is, if you're the owner of one of the coins,

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,620
there's going to be consumed in this transaction,

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,890
then you have to sign this transaction to say that

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,310
you're really okay with spending this coin.

27
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,480
The rules of Scrooge coin say that

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,130
a PayCoins transaction is valid if four things are true.

29
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,100
First, the consumed coins are valid.

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,150
They really were created in previous transactions.

31
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,220
Second, the consumed coins were not already consumed in some previous transaction,

32
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,330
that is, this is not a double-spending.

33
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,560
Third, the total value of the coins that come out of

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,510
this transaction is equal to the total value of the coins that went in,

35
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,435
that is, only Scrooge can create new value.

36
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:48,515
Forth, the transaction is correctly signed by owners of all the consumed coins.

37
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,750
If all of these conditions are met,

38
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,310
then this PayCoins transaction is valid and Scrooge will accept it.

39
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,910
He'll write it into the history by appending it to the blockchain,

40
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,615
after which everyone can see that this transaction has happened.

41
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:04,070
It is only at this point that the participants can

42
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,730
accept that this transaction has actually occurred.
