1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
The key technical problems we need to solve in bitcoins are,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,870
who maintains the ledger or the block chain,

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,580
who can decide which transactions are valid,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,450
who creates new bitcoins,

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,615
who determines how the rules of the system can change,

6
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:16,680
and how do bitcoins acquire exchange values?

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,845
In addition, we need infrastructure support for bitcoins.

8
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:22,325
That includes exchange, wallet software,

9
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:24,240
and service providers, and so on.
