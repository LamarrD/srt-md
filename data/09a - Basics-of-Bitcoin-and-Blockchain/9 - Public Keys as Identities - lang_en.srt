00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,105
Public key can be used as an identity.

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:07,409
For example, if you can verify a signature using a person's public key,

3
00:00:07,409 --> 00:00:11,795
you can think of it as a person who owns the public key has stated the message.

4
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:16,025
Of course, you can create a valid signature only because you have the private key.

5
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:19,680
Therefore, by creating a valid signature or speak of a message,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,075
it means that you can prove to anybody that you're already the owner of the public key.

7
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:27,780
Here's how we can use public key to create a new identity.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,780
First, we'll create a new random pair of public key and private key.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,190
The public key or the hash of the public key becomes your name or your ID.

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,355
But the private key is really what you can use to prove your identity.

11
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:45,000
The advantage of this approach is that since only you who have the private key,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,255
nobody can forge your identity;

13
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,620
and if the public key looks very random,

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,555
nobody really knows who you are.

15
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:55,645
Another advantage is the decentralized identity management.

16
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:59,790
That is, anybody can create a new identity at anytime.

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,380
In fact, you can make as many identities as you want.

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,469
There's no central point of control or coordination.

19
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:10,770
These public key-based identities are called addresses in Bitcoin
