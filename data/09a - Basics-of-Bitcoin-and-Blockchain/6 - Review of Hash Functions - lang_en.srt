00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
Now, let's have a quick review of hash functions.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,805
There are several important properties of cryptographic hash functions.

3
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:09,105
First, it is easy to compute.

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:12,430
You can compute the hash of a message of any size.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,930
For a given hash function,

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,235
it produces fixed length output.

7
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:19,465
Hash function is a one-way function, that is,

8
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:21,150
given the hash of the message,

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,765
it is not easy to find the original message.

10
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:27,470
Hash functions are also designed to be collision resistant.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,895
That is, given a particular message, m_1,

12
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:34,020
it is computationally infeasible to find a different message, m_2,

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,180
such that m_2 and m_1 have

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,710
the same hash value and that is the weak collision-resistant property.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:50,180
A strong collision

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,815
resistant property states that,

17
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:54,740
computationally, it is infeasible to find

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,070
two different messages such that they've the same hash value.
