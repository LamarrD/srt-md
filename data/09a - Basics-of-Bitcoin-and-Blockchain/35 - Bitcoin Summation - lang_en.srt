00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,550
To summarize this lesson,

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,710
let's think about what a 51 percent attacker can do,

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,005
that is, an attacker that controls 51 percent of the computing power.

4
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:11,030
Can the attacker steal Bitcoins?

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,225
No, because digital signatures can prevent this.

6
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:17,425
Can the attacker suppress some transactions from the blockchain?

7
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:21,875
Yes, because this attacker can refuse to extend from that block.

8
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:25,305
Can the attacker suppress transactions from Peer-2-Peer network?

9
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:29,425
No, because the transitions are broadcasted to Peer-2- Peer network.

10
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:31,140
Can they change the block reward?

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,805
No. That is determined by the whole system.

12
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:36,500
Can the attacker destroy confidence in Bitcoin?

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,030
Yes. For example, by refusing to extend from the valid block,

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,400
then Bitcoin may become useless for valid transactions.
