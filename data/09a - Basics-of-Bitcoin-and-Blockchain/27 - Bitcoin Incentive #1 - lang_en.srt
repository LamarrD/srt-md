1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,805
The first incentive is that,

2
00:00:01,805 --> 00:00:03,135
for node to create a block,

3
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:04,425
the node can create

4
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:07,890
a special transaction and can choose the recipient of this transaction.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,905
Typically, that's itself.

6
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:12,540
In particular, this coin creation transaction,

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,980
the value is fixed as,

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,990
for example, 25 bitcoins.

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,420
On the other hand, the block creator can collect

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,385
this reward only if the block is accepted by the nodes.

11
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:25,360
That means, this block ends up in the long-term consensus branch.

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,570
Again, block reward is how bitcoins are created,

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,915
but there are a finite supply of bitcoins.

14
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:32,425
Unless we change the rules,

15
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:35,160
bitcoins can run out in the year 2040.
