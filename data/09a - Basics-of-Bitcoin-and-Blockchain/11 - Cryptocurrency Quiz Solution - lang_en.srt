00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,645
First, the security of cryptocurrency ledgers depends on the honesty of its miners.

2
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:08,640
This is true, and we will discuss some of the details later.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,400
Second, most cryptocurrencies are designed to

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,210
maintain production to keep inflation in check.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,460
This is false. Most cryptocurrencies are designed to

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,810
reduce production mimicking the markets of precious metals.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,255
Third, since cryptocurrencies are pseudo-anonymous,

8
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:27,840
it is okay that they are more susceptible to law enforcement seizure.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,230
This is false. Cryptocurrencies are

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,790
pseudo-anonymous and they are less susceptible to law enforcement seizure.
