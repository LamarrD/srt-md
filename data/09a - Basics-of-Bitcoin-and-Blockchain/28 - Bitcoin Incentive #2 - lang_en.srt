1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
Another incentive that Bitcoin can provide is the so-called transaction fees.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,765
Suppose we have a lot of new Bitcoins,

3
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:08,940
then we'll now create a new block.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,855
How do we reward this node?

5
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:13,440
Remember, a block contains transaction and

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
therefore this block creator can collect transaction fees.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,690
That is, the creator of transactions can

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,470
choose to make output value less than input value.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,485
The difference is the fee paid to the block creator.

10
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,455
Currently, this is like a tip.

11
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:28,750
But in the future, when Bitcoins run out,

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,230
this may become monetary.
