1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,995
Since the length is three,

2
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:03,585
you should go to slot three,

3
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:06,375
but Sue is already in slot three.

4
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,460
Therefore, there is a collision,

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,480
in fact, that's the weakness of this hash function.
