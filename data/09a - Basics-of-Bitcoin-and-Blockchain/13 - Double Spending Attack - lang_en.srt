1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
Let's say Alice pass a coin to Bob by sending her a sign statement to Bob,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,045
but didn't tell anyone else.

3
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:10,710
She could create another sign statement that pays the very same coin to Chuck.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,450
To Chuck, this would appear to be a perfectly valid transaction,

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,025
and now he thinks he's the owner of the coin.

6
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,735
Bob and Chuck would both have valid-looking claims to be the owner of this coin.

7
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:24,160
This is called a double spending attack.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,480
That is, Alice is spending the same coin twice.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,365
Intuitively, we know coins are not supposed to work this way.

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,680
In fact, double spending attacks are one of

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,220
the key problems to any cryptocurrency has to solve.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,775
GoofyCoin does not solve the double spending attack,

13
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:41,865
and therefore, it is not secure.

14
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:46,885
GoofyCoin is simple, and its mechanism for transferring coins is very similar to Bitcoin.

15
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:48,475
But because it is insecure,

16
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:50,160
it is not a cryptocurrency.
