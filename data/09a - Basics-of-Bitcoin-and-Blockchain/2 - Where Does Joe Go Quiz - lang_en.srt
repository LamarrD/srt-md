00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
First, let's do a quiz on hash table.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,320
Suppose we want to store pointers to student records in a hash table,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,380
the hash function is the length of the name mod 5.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,950
Therefore, for Alice, since the length is 5,

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,060
her record is going to be stored in slot 0,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,810
John will be in slot 4,

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,235
and Sue will be in slot 3,

8
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,100
so where will Joe go?
