1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,225
Now we come to the core problem with ScroogeCoin.

2
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:07,820
ScroogeCoin will work in a sense that people can see which coins are valid.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,060
It prevents double spending because everyone can look into the blockchain and see

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,830
that all the transactions are valid and that every coin is consumed only once.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,250
But the problem is that Scrooge has too much influence.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,305
He cannot create fake transactions because he cannot afford other people's signatures.

7
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:27,900
But Scrooge could stop endorsing transactions for

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,890
some users denying their service and making their coins unspendable,

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,320
or Scrooge can be greedy and he could

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,225
refuse to publish transactions unless he gets a fee.

11
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:41,560
Scrooge can of course create as many new coins for himself as he wants.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,895
The problem here is centralization.

13
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:46,030
Although Scrooge is happy with the system,

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,430
the users might not be.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,650
Cryptocurrencies with a central authority have largely failed to take off and

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,110
the main reason is that it is difficult for people to

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,955
accept a cryptocurrency with a centralized authority.

18
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:59,990
Therefore, a key technical challenge is that can we

19
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,120
create a cryptocurrency without a central authority.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,245
To do this, we must figure out how we can agree upon

21
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:09,810
a single published blockchain with history of all the transactions.

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,470
The users must all agree which transactions are

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,320
valid and which transactions have actually occurred.

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,495
They also need to be able to assign IDs to things in a decentralized way.

25
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:24,760
Finally, the mining of new coins needs to be controlled in a decentralized way.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,960
If we can solve all of these problems,

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,105
then we can build a currency that will be like

28
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:32,030
ScroogeCoin but without a centralized authority.

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,360
In fact, this will be a system very much like Bitcoin.
