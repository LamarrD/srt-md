00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
First, proof of work is costly and time consuming to produce, this is true.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,150
Second, proof of work is costly and time consuming to verify, this is false.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,050
Third, to earn a coin,

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,510
miners of bitcoins must complete some of the work in the block,

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,505
this is false because minor must complete all the work in a block.

6
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:22,515
Fourth, changing a block requires degenerating

7
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:26,660
all the successors and re-doing the work that they contain, this is true.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,160
In fact, this is a temporary system property.
