1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
To select a random node,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,750
we can select nodes in proportion to resource that no one can monopolize.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,490
In particular, we can use proof of work to select

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,235
a node that is in proportion to computing power.

5
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:14,930
Alternatively, we can select nodes in proportion to ownership.
