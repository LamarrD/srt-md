1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,140
Let's discuss S-BGP in more detail.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,870
The users IPsec to protect
the point-to-point router communication.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,190
It also assumes PKI.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,700
The reason is that it uses public key
cotography to provide attestations.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,180
In particular address attestation

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,210
proves the authorization to
advertise certain address blocks.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,670
And route attestations
proves the validation

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,910
of the route update information.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,490
And of course S-BGP
requires repositories and

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,640
tools to manage certificates.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,580
The certificate's revocation lists and
the address attestations.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,070
Here's an example of address blocks
advertised by autonomous system

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,950
nodes seven.

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,920
That is as the routing
information is being publicated.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,450
all the nodes need to know that
nodes seven is responsible for

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,720
these addresses.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,740
Now let's discuss
attestation in more detail.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,660
In address attestation, the issuer is
the organization that owns the address

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,160
prefixes contained in the attestation
and the subject is one or

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,890
more ASS that are authorized
to advertise these prefixes.

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,870
For example,

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,810
this ASS are the organization's
internet service providers.

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,070
In other words, an AS such as an ASP
has to be authorized by the owner

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,000
of the address blocks to advertise
the route to these address blocks.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,830
An address at the station includes
the following information.

26
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,830
Essentially it certifies that
the owner owns the address blocks and

27
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,440
the owner authorizes the AS to
advertise for this address blocks.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,130
The owner uses his private key
to sign the address blocks.

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,950
Address attestation is used to
protect BGP from incorrect updates.

30
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,560
The second type of attestation
is route attestation.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,920
Here the issuer or
the speaker is an AS and the subject or

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,420
the listener is a transit AS.

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,070
Basically, route attestation allows
BGP speaker that receives a route

34
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,160
advertisement to verify that each AS
along the route has been authorized

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,479
by the preceding AS along
the path to advertise that route.

36
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,580
And that the originating AS has been
authorized by the owner of each IP

37
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,330
address prefix contained in the update
to advertise these prefixes.

38
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,680
Route Attestation includes
the following information.

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,540
The speakers certificate,
the address block and

40
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,150
the list of AS's, the neighbor,
and the expiration date.

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,250
The signature guarantees
that the organization

42
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,860
owning the IP address space advertised
in the update was allocated that

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,330
address space through a chain of
delegation originating at the eye can.

44
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,160
And this can protect BGP
from incorrect updates.

45
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,940
In order to validate a route, an AS
needs to perform address attestation for

46
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,670
each organization owning
the address block.

47
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,350
And also, route attestation for
each AS along the path.

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,340
And of course, all the certificates must
be available, and they must be valid.
