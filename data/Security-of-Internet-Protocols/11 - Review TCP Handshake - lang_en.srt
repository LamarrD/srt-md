00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,840
Let's review how TCP Handshake works.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,460
The client sends a SYN packet to server.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,910
We randomly generated
initial sequence number.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,760
The server sends a SYN/ACK
packet to the client.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,630
It also has a randomly generated
initial sequence number.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,490
And also acknowledged the sequence
number of the SYN packet

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,490
from the client.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,530
And then the client sends the ACK
packet back to the server.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,800
It also acknowledges the sequence number
of the SYN/ACK packet from the server.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,540
At this point the connection
is established.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,800
Once a connection is established both
sides can expect that their next packet

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,150
will have the sequence number that is
increment from the previous packets.

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,540
Now of course packets
can arrive out of order.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,260
But one can expect that the sequence
number should not be too far

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,620
out of the current window.

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,130
Therefore, if packets arrives
with a sequence number

17
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,870
that's too far out of the current
window it would be dropped.
