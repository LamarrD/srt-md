1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,780
Let's illustrate how BGP works.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,480
Here, the nodes
are the autonomous systems.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,730
And the edges represent
peering relations.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,270
Here, nod 2 provides transit to node 7,
and this information is propagated,

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,740
so all autonomous systems
know how to reach node 7.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,440
The main security issues of BGP
are due to the fact that BGP path

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,220
information is not authenticated which
means that anyone can inject false

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,570
advertisements and such advertisements
will be propagated everywhere.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,350
As a result, attackers can shape and
route traffic to launch

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,200
denial of service attacks,
send spams and perform eavesdroppings.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,330
Here's an example of BGP path hijacking.

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,480
Here's a normal or legitimate path.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,057
And then, there was path
hijacking event in February 2013.

14
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:53,789
In this attack, only the path
of this direction is changed.

15
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,080
The other direction is not changed.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,470
Therefore, if you are in DC,

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,985
because this direction is not changed,
you cannot tell by doing traceroute.
