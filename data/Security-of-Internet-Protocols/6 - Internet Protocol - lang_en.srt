1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,689
At the IP layer, the IP Protocol
routes packet from host a to host b

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,970
approaching never
boundaries if necessary.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,010
The routing is connectionless because
it is best effort only and unreliable.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,090
Meaning that, it's not guaranteed that,

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,930
all packets from host
a will arrive at host b.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,590
And of course, for each IP packet,
the source IP address and

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,440
the destination IP address
must be specified.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,810
The ports are not part of the IP header
because they're for the transport layer.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,780
Here's an example of IP routing.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,900
Suppose, we have a packet with
source and destination IP addresses.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,560
Typically, a route will
involve multiple hops.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,650
An IP routing has no guarantee of the
order or even delivery of the packets.

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,510
In this example, the packet
starts from the source IP address

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,550
reaches the gateway of its ISP, across
network boundary to reach the gateway of

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,030
the destination network and then finally
reaches the destination IP address.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,980
The summary from this example, the IP
host knows how to reach the gateway and

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,980
the gateway knows how to
reach other networks.

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,790
If a data segment is too large, it may
be fragmented into multiple IP packets.

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,090
At the receiving end, these fragments
will be assembled back together.

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,920
If the destination did not
receive a packet or fragment,

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,810
you can send an ICMP packet to
the source to report the error.

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,520
ICMP stands for
Internet Control Message Protocol.

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,880
The IP header can also
include a TTL field.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,600
TTL stands for Time to Live and this
field is decremented after every hop and

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,510
a packet is dropped if TTL reaches 0.

26
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,470
TTL is useful to prevent infinite loops.
