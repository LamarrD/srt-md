1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,515
Now let's look at the transport
layer protocols, in particular,

2
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:05,696
the transmission control protocol or
TCP.

3
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:10,457
TCP is connection-oriented and
it preserves the order of packets,

4
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:13,550
we can use an analogy to explain TCP.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,750
Suppose we want to mail a book, and

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,700
the way we send the book is to
mail each page in envelope.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,690
And that's analogous to breaking
application data into TCP packets.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,600
And of course, for each page,
there's a page number, so

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,290
that we know the sequence of
these pages in the original book.

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,610
Likewise, TCP packets
have sequence numbers.

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,890
Now, when the pages arrive,
they arrive in separate envelopes and

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,290
may be out of order.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,330
At the destination, we make sure
that we receive all the pages,

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,380
put them back in order and
reassemble the book.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,850
Similarly, at the definition host,
each packet upon it's receipt,

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,920
will be acknowledged.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,520
And any lost packet will be notified so
that the source can resend the packet

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,310
and then the packet will be
reassembled in the original order.

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,050
Now let's take a look at TCP Header,
it includes the port numbers,

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,790
the sequence number of the packet and
acknowledgement number.

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,270
That is for acknowledging
a previously received packet.

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,660
It also has a number of flux, these
are used to control the TCP connection.
