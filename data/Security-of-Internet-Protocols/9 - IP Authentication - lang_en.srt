1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,569
Record it in the IP header,

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:06,130
the source and destination IP
addresses must be specified.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:12,340
However, one can easily override
the source IP address using raw sockets.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,630
For example, you can use the Libnet
library to format raw packets

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,540
with arbitrary IP header information
including the source IP address.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,410
This means that there's no guarantee
that the source ID address is authentic.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,550
This means that anyone who owns
the machine, and knows how to use a tool

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,980
like dimnet, can send packets with
arbitrarily sourced IP addresses.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,480
Now of course, a response will be sent
back to the forged source IP address.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,210
For example, host A can send packets
forging the source IP address of

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,190
host B and then the response
will be sent back to host B.

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,100
The ability to forge arbitrary
source IP addresses enables

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,750
anonymous denial-of-service attacks and
anonymous infection and malware attacks.
