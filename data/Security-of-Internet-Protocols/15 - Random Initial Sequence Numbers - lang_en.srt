1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,682
We call that in TCP handshake,
the first packet from the client and

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:08,520
the first packet from the server have
the sequence numbers randomly generated.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,230
This is very important.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,730
Suppose, these initial sequence
numbers are predictable.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,960
Then the attacker can forge
a source ID address and

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,410
still be able to finish the TCP
handshake and establish a TCP session.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,740
And this will break IP-based
authentication such as SPF,

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,030
which is Sender Policy Framework
that is used to authenticate email.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,700
We can use an example to illustrate
the importance of having random

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,650
initial sequence numbers.

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,370
Suppose there's an attacker and

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,860
he wants to forge the source IP address
of the victim to create a TCP session.

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,470
So the attacker sends the initial
SYN packet to the server and

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,390
forge the source IP address
to be from the victim.

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,030
Now the server is going to send
a SYN/ACK packet to the victim

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,480
with its own sequence number.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,150
Of course, the attacker did
not receive the SYN/ACK packet

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,780
because the SYN/ACK packet
is sent to the victim.

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,129
Now if this sequence
number is predictable,

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,720
then the attacker can still send ACK
packet to ACK this SYN packet as if

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,870
that the attacker had
received the SYN/ACK packet.

22
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,870
And when a server receives this
ACK packet on its SYN/ACK packet,

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,380
then the server knows that
the connection should be established.

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,020
>From this point on, the attacker can
send command through the server and

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,190
the server will think that
the command is from its victim.

26
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,540
Because the victim and the server
hasn't established TCP connection.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,740
Here's an example of attacks on
predictable sequence numbers,

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,210
suppose the attacker can correctly
guess the sequence number.

29
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,900
He can then send a reset packet.

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,350
This will terminate a connection and
result in the null service attack.
