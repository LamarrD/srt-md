1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,763
Again, from the perspective of routing,

2
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:06,483
the Internet is a collection of
domains or autonomous systems.

3
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:10,977
An autonomous system is a connected
group of computers where their

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:15,872
IP addresses share some common prefixes,
and they're using a single or

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,060
common routing policy.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,660
The routing between these
domains is determined by BGP.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,980
And the routing within each domain is
determined by protocols such as OSPF.

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,780
Now let's discuss the security
of routing protocols.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,013
Recall that the ARP protocol
maps IP address to MAC address.

10
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:40,429
Now, suppose there's an ARP request
asking for the MAC address for

11
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:42,590
node B's IP address.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,180
This ARP request is broadcasted
to the whole network.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,080
Now if node A is malicious,

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,420
it can send ARP reply to the gateway
with its own Mac address.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,180
If this reply arrives at the gateway
before the reply of node B does,

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,430
then the gateway will think
that node A is node B.

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,050
Which means that node A now is right
in the middle, and you can read or

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,010
inject packets into node B sessions.

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,493
The Border Gateway Protocol, or BGP,

20
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:14,189
decides the routing policy
between autonomous systems.

21
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,888
However, in BGP routing information,
and in particular route updates,

22
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:20,463
are not authenticated.

23
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:24,645
Therefore, through a false
advertisement, an attacker can cause

24
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:29,209
traffic to a victim host to instead
route to the attacker's own address.

25
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:32,344
There are plenty of examples
illustrating the danger of

26
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:34,580
false route advertisement.

27
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,540
Essentially, anyone can
hijack route to victim
