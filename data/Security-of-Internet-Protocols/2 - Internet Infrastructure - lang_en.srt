00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,460
You can think of the Internet as
a collection of large networks.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,140
These large networks
are typically managed

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,620
by the Internet Service Providers,
or the ISPs.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,340
The ISPs work together to allow traffic
to flow from one network to another.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,840
So to the users, the Internet is
just one big connected network.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,970
Because a user can reach from his
computer on one end of the Internet

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,820
to another computer on
the other end of the Internet.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,795
The computers within a local
area network use the local and

9
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:36,250
inter-domain routing protocol
to communicate with each other.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,890
Computers from different networks,
for example,

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,120
from two different ISP networks,
use TCP/IP protocol to communicate.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,950
But in order to decide how to send
traffic from host A to host B which may

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,560
be in two separate ISP networks,
there needs to be routing information

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,635
which is decided by BGP which stands for
border gateway protocol.

15
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:02,765
The domain name system is a distributed,
hierarchical database system

16
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:06,975
that provides the mapping between an IP
address and a symbol domain name,

17
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:11,864
such as www.cc.gatech.edu.
