1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
With regards to computing. What is entropy?

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,810
Entropy is randomness for use in cryptography

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,050
or other applications that require random data.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,270
What are the two sources of entropy?

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,915
Hardware sources or randomness generators.

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:21,410
A lack of entropy will have a negative impact on performance and security.
