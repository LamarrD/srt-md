1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
At a high level, there are several worrisome observations.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,560
First, the certificate authorities are ignoring defense in depth, a least privilege.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,800
They are offering services that put the whole ecosystem at risk and they're

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,130
using some weak keys and deploying HTTPS remains difficult.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,800
Let's go on with these observations next.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,490
For defense in depth, there are several technical practices already in

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,770
place for limiting the scope of a signing certificate including setting,

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,205
name or path length constrains and distributing

9
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:39,270
leave certificates among a large number of intermediate certificates.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,610
There are clear cases for using these restrictions but the vast majority of the time,

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,000
the CA's do not utilize these options.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,060
As another example, local domain names are not

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:57,095
fully qualified and intended resource is ambiguous and there is no identifiable owner.

14
00:00:57,095 --> 00:01:02,760
As such, these local domain names frequently appear on more than one certificate.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,255
In one example, there are about 1,218 browser trusted certificates for a domain male,

16
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:14,880
owned by organizations ranging from the U.S. Department of Defense to small companies.

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,750
In terms of the keys used,

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,655
the researchers also find that 90 percent of the certificates

19
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:25,920
use a 2048 bit or 4096 bit RSA keys.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,570
But 50 percent of the certificates are rooted in the 1024 bit key.

21
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,395
More importantly, more than 70 percent of these will expire

22
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:39,510
after 2016 and many still use signs using MD5.
