00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
While there are many excellent multi-purpose network scanners,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,145
these scanners were never intended or optimized for scanning the entire Internet.

3
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:09,810
ZMap, on the other hand,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,000
was designed from the ground up for

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,650
the specific purpose of completely scanning the whole Internet.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,900
Let's compare existing network scanners with ZMap.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,510
Existing network scanners need quite immense amount of

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,250
resources to keep track of state of the entire Internet.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,490
ZMap, on the other hand,

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,280
eliminate local per-connection state.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,000
Existing scanners also spend a lot of resources keeping

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,245
track of which host is being scanned and which host have responded.

13
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,325
On the other hand, ZMap uses

14
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:42,930
Shotgun Scanning Approach and keeps minimum state information.

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,965
Previous scanners have been attempting to be more polite by slowing the scans.

16
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,380
ZMap, on the other hand,

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,590
distributes the scan across the Internet.

18
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,760
This allow ZMap to scan at

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,100
more aggressive rate without impacting the destination networks.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,600
Finally, ZMap also bypasses

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,370
the inefficient network stack in

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,000
the operating system and generate outgoing packets directly.
