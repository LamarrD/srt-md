00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,615
Many previous projects have used the popular Nmap network scanner to perform scans.

2
00:00:05,615 --> 00:00:08,890
Therefore, we should compare ZMap with Nmap.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,970
The researchers performed several experiments focusing

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,450
on the total time spent for scanned and scan coverage.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,730
In these experiments, one million addresses were scanned.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,690
In these experiments, Nmap used the most aggressive scan template called

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,510
insane and with a minimal scan rate of 10,000 packets per second.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,595
As we can see from these results,

9
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:35,810
ZMap is capable of scanning the IPv4 address

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,800
space more than 1,300 times faster than Nmap.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,810
ZMap also has higher coverage than Nmap even when Nmap sends multiple probes.

12
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,210
To be fair, Nmap is

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,370
an excellent multi-purpose network scanner and it is

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,440
optimized for completely different use cases than ZMap.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,515
So why does ZMap have higher coverage than Nmap?

16
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:02,885
We analyzed the response time of the scan responses.

17
00:01:02,885 --> 00:01:06,390
ZMap does not timeout hosts, but Nmap does.

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,775
In fact, if Nmap sent one packet,

19
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:11,585
it times out after 250 milliseconds.

20
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:12,975
If it uses two packets,

21
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:16,110
it times out after 500 milliseconds.

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,865
As you can see, some responses arrive after Nmap has timed out.

23
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:25,905
Ultimately, since ZMap uses stateless scanning and does not keep state,

24
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:29,980
it has both increased performance and increased coverage.

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,870
Ultimately, since ZMap uses stateless scanning,

26
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,000
it has both increased performance and increased coverage.
