The Internet is a large ecosystem of networks.

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:06,575
It is also a large ecosystem of vulnerabilities.

3
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:09,710
To defend the network, we need to know it.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,258
In other words, we need to map the entire Internet.

5
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:15,905
In this lesson, we'll learn how to map the internet

6
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,230
efficiently and thoroughly, and survey vulnerabilities.
