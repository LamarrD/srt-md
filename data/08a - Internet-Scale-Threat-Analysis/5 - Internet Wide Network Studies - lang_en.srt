00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,355
In fact there have been quite a few inferential Internet-Wide Network Studies.

2
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:09,420
For example, in 2012 researchers at

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,000
the University of Michigan released a paper

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,420
describing the weak keys used in network devices.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,380
In particular, they found vulnerabilities in more than five percent of HTTPS hosts and

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,520
10 percent of SSH hosts but a study required a lot of computing powers and time.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,680
Similarly there's a study from

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,000
the Electronic Frontier Foundation on public key certificates.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,630
Again the study requires a lot of effort and

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,365
a comprehensive scan of the whole internet also requires months of efforts.

11
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:49,945
All these projects require heroic effort just to perform initial data collection.

12
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:52,840
As you can see these scans require

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,040
massive polarization and typically they also require an extended period of time.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,843
Given the benefits of Internet-Wide Network Security Studies

15
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:05,000
we want to see just a few more of them.
