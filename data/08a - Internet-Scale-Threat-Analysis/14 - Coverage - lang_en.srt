00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,845
Another interesting question is,

2
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:07,740
"Is one probe packet sufficient or is sending multiple packets beneficial?"

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,010
This is difficult to answer directly because there is

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,697
no ground truth for the number of live hosts on the Internet.

5
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:17,590
In order to estimate ZMap coverage,

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,545
multiples in packets were sent to one percent samples of the IPv4 address space.

7
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:29,700
If you look at the number of responses we clearly see a plateau after a SYN packets.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,190
In fact, we should expect to see an eventual plateau in a number

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,745
of responsive hosts regardless of additional SYN packets sent.

10
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:44,765
Analyzing these results we can estimate that with a single packet the coverage is about

11
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:51,000
97.9 percent and with three packets the coverage is 99.4 percent.
