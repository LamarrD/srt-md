00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,310
We have discussed how we can scan [inaudible] state information,

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,995
but how do we validate the responses?

3
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:12,720
The idea here is that we can encode secrets into the fields of the probe packets.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,640
This is similar to the SYN cookies.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,560
Here are the formats of the Ethernet,

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,600
IP and TCP packets,

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,470
and some of the fields here can be used to encode the secrets.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,350
In order to validate packets, we receive.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,900
We encode a scan invocation and host-specific secret into

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,995
mutable fields that will have a recognizable effect on the probe responses.

11
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:40,280
Specifically, for each scan host ZMap computes

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,120
a hash of the destination address keyed by the scan's specific secret.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,570
This MAC value or Message Authentication Code

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,100
is then spread across any appropriate and available fields.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,185
In the case of using a TCP SYN packet for scanning,

16
00:00:57,185 --> 00:01:02,075
we encode the secret into the source port and sequence number.

17
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:04,750
We know that the destination host will have to

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,995
include the port and sequence number to send a response.

19
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:15,130
For example, a sequence number will be encoded into the acknowledgement number field.

20
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,870
More precisely, in response packet the receiver port was the sender port in

21
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,720
the scanning packet and

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,000
the acknowledgement number is the sequence number of the scanning packet.
