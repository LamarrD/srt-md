00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
There are a lot of benefits from Internet Wide Security Scanning.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,685
For example, we can discover new vulnerabilities,

3
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:12,720
we can understand how a defensive mechanism has been adopted.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,675
On the other hand, Internet Wide Security Scanning means that

5
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:20,870
we have to probe the entire address space and with existing tools,

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,920
this is very difficult and slow task.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,410
On the other hand, some of the Security Studies

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,805
does require the scanning of the entire address space.

9
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:34,900
For example, if we can obtain the cryptographic keys in the entire address space,

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,015
then we can understand the ecosystem of

11
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:40,040
public key infrastructure and its vulnerabilities.
