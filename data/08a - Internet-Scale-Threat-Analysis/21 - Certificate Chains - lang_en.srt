00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Let's have a quick review of how certificates is used in Web browsing.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,650
Browsers such as Firefox decide who they trust.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,320
These certificates are stored as part of the browser or the operating system.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,150
Browsers typically support a couple of hundred root certificates, such as this.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,450
These root certificate authorities then agree to sign other certificates for example,

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,760
Equifax is a root certificate authority and agrees to sign Google with authority.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,620
And this can go on in moving

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,825
multiple intermediates and we end up having a certificate chains.

9
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,815
That is, if you look at Google.com,

10
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:40,800
it's signed by a chain of certificates and a top

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,340
certificate is just a self-signed certificate.

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,680
This entire chain is presented by

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,970
Web browser to the client and the client can verify the signatures

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,230
by traversing the certificate chain

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,250
up to the browser trusted certificate, which is self-signed.

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,260
The researchers at the University of Michigan perform

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,225
regular scans to try the use of certificates.

18
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:09,405
They observe 3,700 browser trusted certificates in one year.

19
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:13,775
They also discovered two cases of misused certificates.

20
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:20,145
In one case, a signing certificate was accidentally issued to a Turkish transit provider.

21
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:26,000
In another case, 1,300 certificates were issued by the Korean government.
