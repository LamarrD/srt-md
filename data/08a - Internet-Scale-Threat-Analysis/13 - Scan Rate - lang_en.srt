00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
The first major question is whether ZMap

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,585
or our network can handle scanning at gigabit speed.

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:09,480
In order to answer this question researchers at

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,267
the University of Michigan perform 10 trials scanning one percent of the IPB for address

5
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:19,260
space at different rates ranging from 1,000 packets per

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,080
second to the maximum 1.4 million packets per second.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,825
This maximum is determined by the NIC configuration.

8
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:31,050
NIC stands for network interface card.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,350
As we can see there is no correlation

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,269
between a scanning rate and the number of hosts that respond.

11
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:40,785
One way to interpret this result is that

12
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:45,000
even slower scanning rates does not produce additional response.
