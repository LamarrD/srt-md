1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,265
The researchers found 1,800 signed certificates belonging to

2
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:09,965
683 organizations and these include various kinds of institutions.

3
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,270
The most worrisome finding is that

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,926
all major browser roots are selling

5
00:00:14,926 --> 00:00:18,750
intermediates to third parties without any constraints.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,030
By analyzing the certificate chains,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,140
we see that 90 percent of the certificates are signed by five organizations.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,620
They are sent from four roots and signed by

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,700
40 intermediates and there are only a few big players.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,940
Another interesting fact is that 26 percent of

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,000
the trusted sites are signed by only a single intermediate certificate.
