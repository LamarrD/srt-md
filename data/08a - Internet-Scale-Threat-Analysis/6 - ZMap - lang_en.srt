1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,673
But in order to do that,

2
00:00:01,673 --> 00:00:05,555
Internet surveys should not require heroic efforts.

3
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:11,446
For example, it would be nice if we can scan the whole HTTPS ecosystem every day.

4
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:14,042
Given that existing tools are so slow,

5
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:18,244
researchers at the University of Michigan wrote ZMap,

6
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:21,200
a new Internet scanner, from scratch.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,050
ZMap is a fully-functional open-source network scanner that can

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,098
scan a single port on the IPv4 address space.

9
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:30,598
On a gigabit network,

10
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,680
it can cover 98 percent of

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,340
the IPv4 address space from a single machine in under 45 minutes.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,600
With ZMap, performing a scan on the Internet no longer

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,865
requires hundreds of hours of coding or months to execute.

14
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:47,990
Now, performing an Internet scan is

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,350
a single command which could be finished within an hour.
