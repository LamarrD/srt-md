1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Which protocol is used to break data into packets?

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,340
It is TCP. Which protocol is used to move packets from router to router?

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,560
It's IP, the internet protocol.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,665
Which protocol reassembles the data packets?

5
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,555
Again, it's TCP.

6
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:18,705
And here's an illustration of the concepts in the quiz.

7
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:22,980
On the sender's side, the TCP protocol breaks data into packets.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,170
When a packet comes out of the sender,

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,160
the routers are responsible for sending a packet to the recipient.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,455
And the recipient, the TCP protocol,

11
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:35,240
again resembles the packets back into the original data.
