00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,340
Since HTTPS is HTTP over SSL,
let's briefly review SSL/TLS.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,260
It uses public key for
authentication and key exchange.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,970
As a quick review,
in public key cryptography,

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,480
each user, say Bob, has a pair
of public key and private key.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,610
And Alice,
after obtaining Bob's public key,

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,650
can use Bob's public key to encrypt
message into cypher text, and a cypher

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,550
text can only be encrypted by Bob,
using the corresponding private key.
