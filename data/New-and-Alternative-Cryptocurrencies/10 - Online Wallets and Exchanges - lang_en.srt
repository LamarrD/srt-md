00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,775
Now, let's discuss bitcoin exchange.

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:07,530
Bitcoin exchange accepts deposits of Bitcoins and fiat currency.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,695
For example, dollars, pounds,

4
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:11,395
euros, and so on.

5
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:16,660
These exchanges let customers make and receive bitcoin payments,

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,315
and buy and sell bitcoins using fiat currency.

7
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:24,300
You would typically match a bitcoin buyer with a bitcoin seller.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,320
Of course, it promises to give the money back to the customer,

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,465
therefore, bitcoin exchanges are similar to banks.

10
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,430
As a result, bitcoin exchanges need to

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,530
meet a number of minimal requirements or expectations.

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,300
For example, bitcoin exchanges should meet the minimum reserve requirements,

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,325
that means they must hold some fraction of deposits in reserve.

14
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:52,340
A Bitcoin exchange needs to provide a proof of reserve to

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,610
give customers some comfort about the money that they have deposited.

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,505
The goal is for the exchange to prove that he has a fraction or reserve,

17
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:07,885
for example, from 35 percent to even 100 percent of the deposits that people have made.

18
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:11,570
We can break the Proof of Reserve problem into two pieces.

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,910
The first is to prove how much reserve you are holding.

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,010
The exchange can simply publish a valid

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,140
payment-to-self transaction of the claimed reserve amount.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,315
That is, if he claims to have 100,000 bitcoins,

23
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:31,320
it creates a transaction in which he pays 100,000

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,990
bitcoins to herself and show that the transaction is valid.

25
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,270
Strictly speaking, this is not a proof that the exchange really owns this amount,

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:46,935
but only that whoever does own this amount is willing to support the exchange.

27
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:50,180
The second piece of the Proof of Reserve problem

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,715
is to prove that how many demand deposits you hold.

29
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:55,730
We will discuss this next.
