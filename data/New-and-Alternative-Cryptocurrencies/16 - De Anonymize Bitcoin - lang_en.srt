1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
We know that in Bitcoin,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,675
it is trivial to create a new address.

3
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:06,300
That is, all you need to do is to create

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,295
a new public key public key pair and a hash of the public key becomes a new address.

5
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:16,225
That is, a single user can own many addresses or many IDs.

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:19,575
In fact, the best practice is to use

7
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:23,835
a fresh new address for the recipient in any new transaction.

8
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:29,395
So, the question is, can the addresses and the transactions still be linked?

9
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,325
Let's consider an example.

10
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:38,030
Suppose Alice wants to buy a teapot from a store and a teapot cost eight Bitcoins.

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,260
Let's further assume that Alice has some Bitcoins in her different addresses.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,385
In order to pay for this teapot,

13
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:52,600
Alice has to create a single transaction that includes input from two addresses.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,635
But in doing so, Alice has revealed that these two addresses belong to the same user.

15
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:02,300
In other words, two previous transactions that

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,760
use these two addresses as recipients must be to the same user.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,465
This example that if you're sure to spending for multiple addresses,

18
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:13,760
we're linking these addresses together.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,455
This example shows that if multiple addresses are using the same spending transaction,

20
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:23,400
that means that these addresses are under joint control.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,835
In other words, we can link these addresses together.

22
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:30,595
Further, address linkability is tentative.

23
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:34,200
Furthermore, we can propagate such linkability.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,185
Let's consider another example.

25
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:42,435
Suppose now, the price of the teapot has gone up from eight Bitcoins to 8.5 bitcoins.

26
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:48,620
So, Alice will create a transaction where she will transfer Bitcoins from two of

27
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:55,645
her addresses to pay for the teapot and also send the change to her own address.

28
00:01:55,645 --> 00:02:00,845
Therefore, Alice will create transaction where she transfers Bitcoins

29
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:06,560
from two of her addresses but also send a change to one of her addresses as well.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,720
So, Alice will create a transaction where she would transfer Bitcoins from two of

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:18,385
her addresses to pay for a teapot but also send a change to another address of hers.

32
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:23,105
Now, let's consider the transaction from the viewpoint of an adversary.

33
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:28,175
He can deduce that these two input addresses belong to the same user.

34
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:31,100
The attacker might also suspect that one of

35
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,890
these output addresses also belongs to the same user.

36
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,300
If the attacker knows that a teapot cost more than 0.5 Bitcoin,

37
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,250
then he would know that this address also belong to the same user.

38
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,285
Therefore, in this example,

39
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:51,475
the attacker can know that these three addresses belong to the same user.

40
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:55,900
We can only link or cast the addresses that belong to the same user.

41
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,625
We can also see if any of these addresses reveals the real identity of a real user.

42
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:08,870
For example, an address may be used in transaction through a provider that is legally

43
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,780
required to know the true user behind

44
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,540
the address or a user may have posted an address in a public forum.

45
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,780
For example, because he's making a donation.
