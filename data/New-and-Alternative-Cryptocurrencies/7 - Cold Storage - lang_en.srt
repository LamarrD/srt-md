1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,025
Now, the remaining question is,

2
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:04,365
how do we keep the cold storage safe?

3
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:06,195
There are multiple options.

4
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:11,055
For example, a user can use his pass phrase to encrypt information.

5
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:14,040
We can even print information on a piece of paper,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,990
or we can use tamperproof device then use hardware to protect the keys.
