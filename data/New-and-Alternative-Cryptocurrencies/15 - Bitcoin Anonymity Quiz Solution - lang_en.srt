1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
First, a timestamping service prevents

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,125
people from double-spending Bitcoins, this is true.

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:11,405
Second, each user has a single Bitcoin that is used in all transactions,

4
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:13,195
this is obviously false.

5
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:17,695
Third, the expenditure of individual coins cannot be tracked,

6
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:20,340
this is false because individual coins

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,500
can be tracked by their chain of digital signatures.
