00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,685
Now, let's discuss anonymity in Bitcoin.

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:07,940
Some, including WikiLeaks, claims that BitCoins provide anonymity.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,980
Others, believe that Bitcoin does not provide anonymity.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,720
So, what is anonymity?

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,340
Literally, anonymous means without a name.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,070
Bitcoin, an ID is an address,

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,735
which is the hash of a public key.

8
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:26,060
In computer science, we call this pseudonymity.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,845
In computer science, an anonymity means pseudonymity plus unlinkability.

10
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:34,690
We know that Bitcoins provides pseudonymity.

11
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,625
Now, the question is does Bitcoin provide unlinkability.

12
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,685
That is, can we be sure that in Bitcoin,

13
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:45,590
different transactions of the same users can be linked together.

14
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,420
More precisely, unlinkability in Bitcoin means that,

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,265
it is also hard to link different transactions of the same user.

16
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:58,930
Furthermore, it should be hard to link the sender of a payment to its recipient.
