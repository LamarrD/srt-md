1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Since we can write whatever data we want into Bitcoin,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,520
we can also view an entirely new currency system on top of Bitcoin,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,395
without needing to develop a new consensus mechanism.

4
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:15,550
That is, we can simply use Bitcoin as it exists today as an append-only

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,450
log and write all the data that we need for

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,125
our new currency system directly into the Bitcoin blockchain.

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,915
We call this approach an overlay currency.

8
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:28,610
That is, Bitcoin serves as the underlying substrate,

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,630
and the data of the overlay currency is written into

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,415
the Bitcoin blockchain using unspendable transaction outputs.

11
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:41,510
Of course, Bitcoin miners will not actually validate what you're

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,250
writing into the blockchain because they don't know the new currency system.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,400
Also, anyone can write anything as long as they're willing to pay the transaction fees.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,250
Since this is a different new currency system,

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,070
you must develop your own logic for validating transactions.
