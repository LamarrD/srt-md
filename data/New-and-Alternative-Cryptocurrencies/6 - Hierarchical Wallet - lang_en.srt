1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,825
Suppose for privacy or other reasons,

2
00:00:02,825 --> 00:00:06,850
we won't to be able to receive each bitcoin at a separate address.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,890
So, whenever we transfer coin from the hot side to the cold side,

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,590
we would like to use a fresh cold edges for that purpose.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,180
But, since the cold side is offline,

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,340
how do the hot side find out those addresses?

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,150
The blunt solution is for the cold side to generate

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,915
a big batch of addresses and send those over to the hot side.

9
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:33,130
The drawback is that the hot side need to reconnect with

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,380
the cold side periodically in order to transfer more addresses.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,335
A better solution is to use the so-called hierarchical wallet.

12
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:48,999
To review, previously we discussed key generation and digital signatures,

13
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:52,595
and we looked at a function called generateKeys.

14
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:56,245
This function generates a public key which acts

15
00:00:56,245 --> 00:01:00,175
as an address and a secret or private key.

16
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:01,990
In a hierarchical wallet,

17
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,780
key generation works in different way.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,320
Instead of generating a single address,

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,615
we generate what we called address generation information.

20
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,640
Rather than private key,

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,815
we generate what we call private key generation information.

22
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:20,600
Given the address generation information,

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,335
we can generate a sequence of addresses.

24
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:26,570
Likewise, we can generate a sequence of

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,030
public keys using the private key generation information.

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,270
The cryptographic magic that makes this useful is that for every i,

27
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,745
the ith address and the ith secret key match up.

28
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:43,475
That is, the ith secret or private key

29
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:48,835
controls and can be used to spend bitcoins from the ith address.

30
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:53,400
That is, the ith private key is paired up with ith address.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,370
In other words, we have a sequence of regular key pairs.

32
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,125
The other important cryptographic property here is security, that is,

33
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,050
the address generation information here does

34
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,025
not leak any information about the private keys.

35
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:12,530
On the other hand, not all digital signature schemes can

36
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,210
be modified to support hierarchical key generation.

37
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,960
The good news is that the digital signature scheme used by bitcoin,

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,915
elliptic curve, does support hierarchical key generation.

39
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:28,940
As a result, the cold side can generate as many keys as it

40
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,685
wants and the hot side can generate the corresponding addresses.

41
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:37,445
To summarize, the cold side create and saves

42
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:41,365
private key generation information and address generation information.

43
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:46,705
It has a one-time transfer of the address generation information to the hot side.

44
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:49,430
The hot side generates a new address

45
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,800
sequentially every time it wants to send a coin to the cold side.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,904
When a cold side reconnects,

47
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:58,700
it generates addresses sequentially and

48
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,175
checks the blockchain for transfers to these addresses.

49
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,520
It can also generate private keys

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,030
sequentially if it wants to send some coins back to the hot side.
