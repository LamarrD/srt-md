1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
Recall that in bitcoin.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,700
A valid transaction has information store in the blockchain,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,080
but also the transactional information has to

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,905
also be signed by the owner's secret signing key,

5
00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:17,735
or that's the private key of the public key pair.

6
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:19,670
Recall that in bitcoin,

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,000
a transaction information is store in the blockchain and it

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,765
also contains a signature signed by the owner's private key.

9
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:32,200
The owners need to keep their private key a secret.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,400
So, this is about key management.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,180
That is, how do you keep your private key secret and secure?

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,710
Of course, you can store your public key in a file on your computer or on your phone.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,215
This is a very convenient approach.

14
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,500
On the other hand, if you're KeyStore is lost,

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,195
that means your private key is lost,

16
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:57,200
which means all your bitcoins are lost.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,930
This is because without the private key,

18
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,410
you cannot prove that you're the owner of the matching public key.

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,315
Remember, all your coins are associated with that public key.

20
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:12,900
That is, your public key is your ID or address in bitcoin.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,710
But, you have to use the private key to

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,290
prove that you're the owner of the public key or the ID.

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,000
Of course, your KeyStore can be compromised,

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,445
which means your public key can be stolen,

25
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:28,820
which means all the bitcoins can also be stolen because now

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,325
the attacker can claim that he's the owner of that public key or the ID.

27
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:37,470
Therefore, he has all your bitcoins.

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,435
For example, the stolen private key,

29
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:43,205
now the attacker can claim that he's the owner

30
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:46,295
of the ID that the bitcoins are associated with.

31
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:50,755
He can then pay those bitcoins to another address that he owns.

32
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:53,660
That way, he can steal all the bitcoins.
