00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Let's recap. To provide a proof of reserve, first,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,840
the exchange proves that they have at least X amount of

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,830
reserve currency by doing a self transaction of X amount.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,955
Then they prove that the customers have at most amount of Y deposited.

5
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:20,735
This shows that their reserve fraction is at least X divided by Y.

6
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:24,695
Notice that a bitcoin exchange can provide this proof,

7
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:27,710
that is independently verifiable by anybody,

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,530
and therefore, no central regulator is required.
