00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,425
The Bitcoin system can be used for other applications.

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:06,220
For example, secure timestamping.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,660
For example, we can prove knowledge of x or we know the value of x at a time

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,435
t. But we can do so without revealing

5
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:19,650
the actual value or knowledge of x at time t. Of course,

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,365
if we choose to, we can review x at some later time.

7
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:27,110
Recall that hash function is a one-way function.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,530
That is, if you publish the hash value of x,

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,200
you're announcing a commitment to x.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Recall that a cryptographic hash function is

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,600
a one-way function and also loses in to collision.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,460
Therefore, if we publish the hash value of x,

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,475
we essentially announcing the commitment to x.

14
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:49,820
In other words, everyone will know that we actually know

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,440
the true value of x by publishing the hash value of x,

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,060
and we don't have to reveal x to anyone.

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,870
In other words, we can later prove that we actually knew

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,740
the value of x because we had published the hash value of x.
