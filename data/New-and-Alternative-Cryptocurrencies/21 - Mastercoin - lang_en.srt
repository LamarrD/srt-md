00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
An example of overlay currency is Mastercoin.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,919
In an overlay currency system, such as Mastercoin,

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,770
there's no need to develop a new consensus algorithm and, therefore,

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,930
developers can instead focus on developing interesting features,

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,110
such as smart contracts.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,260
On the other hand, such an approach can also be inefficient

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,100
because those on the overlay currency may need to process a lot of data.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,880
This is because bitcoin nodes don't filter these transactions for you.
