1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
The so-called hot storage is online,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,259
and the so-called cold storage is offline.

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,405
Hot storage is online,

4
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:12,555
for example, on your computer or on your phone.

5
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:16,320
It's very convenient, but it's not very secure.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,755
On the other hand, cold storage is offline,

7
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:22,950
not convenient, but it's safe.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,750
The reason is obvious,

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,820
if the storage is offline,

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,030
then a cyber attacker cannot get to it easily.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,600
In general, we can keep a top secret in

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,060
a cold storage and put the most frequent used keys.

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:44,000
Here's another way to look at the difference between hot storage and cold storage.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,470
We can put a top secret or the less frequently used master secret in a cold storage.

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,470
We can put the most frequently used keys in hot storage.

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,345
As we just discussed,

17
00:00:56,345 --> 00:01:02,110
storing your keys of Bitcoins on computers is storing them in a hot storage.

18
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,495
It is online, convenient, but somewhat risky.

19
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:09,635
On the other hand, you can put your keys of Bitcoins offline.

20
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:12,485
This is less convenient, but much safer.

21
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:18,315
You can have the best of both worlds by having both hot storage and cold storage.

22
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:21,645
For example, you can move coins back and forth,

23
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:24,860
but then you need to use separate keys and each side

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,510
needs to know each other's keys or the addresses.

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,060
You need to use separate keys because otherwise,

26
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,550
the coins in cold storage will be vulnerable if the hot storage is compromised.

27
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,840
You need to use separate keys because otherwise,

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,280
the coins in a cold storage will be vulnerable if the hot storage is compromised.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,490
You will want to move the coins back and forth between the hot side and the cold side.

30
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,420
So, each side will need to note the others' addresses or public keys.
