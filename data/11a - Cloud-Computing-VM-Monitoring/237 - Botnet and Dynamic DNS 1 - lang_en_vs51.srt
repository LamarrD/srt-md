1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,168
Many botnets use DNS for
command control.

2
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:06,189
A key advantage is that DNS
is used whenever a machine

3
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:08,592
on the internet needs
to talk to another,

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,760
because DNS stores the mapping
between domain name and IP address.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,411
That is DNS is always allowed
in a network and using DNS for

6
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,159
command control won't standout easily.

7
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:21,685
Suppose a malware infects many machines,

8
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:24,610
that is many machines
now have become bots.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,044
The question is how can this
bot organize into a botnet?

10
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:32,369
The bot malware has instructions to
connect to this command control server.

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,773
But in order to connect to
the command control server,

12
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,351
it will perform a DNS lookup first.

13
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:40,237
And with the IP address, the bot can
connect to the command control server

14
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:42,820
and that's how the bot
becomes part of a botnet.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,319
The DNS service providers preferred
by botnets are Dynamic DNS providers,

16
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:51,957
because they allow the frequent changes
of the mapping between DNS domain name

17
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:53,140
and IP address.

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,440
That is the botmaster can change to use
another machine on the internet for

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,510
command control and

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,060
all he needs to do is log into his
Dynamic DNS provider, and make changes.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,261
If we can detect that, a domain is used
for botnet command control, then we can

22
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,272
detect which machine connects to this
domain and this machine is a bot, but

23
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,606
how do we know this domain is used for
botnet command control?

24
00:01:14,606 --> 00:01:18,368
It terms out that way the bots look
at the domain is different from how

25
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:21,668
machines look at instrument
domain such as a news website,

26
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:24,160
because of normal use activities.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,716
For example, a botnet CNC is looked
up by hundreds of thousands of

28
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:29,475
machines across the internet.

29
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:33,052
And yet, it is so-called unknown
according to Google search and

30
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,620
that's an anomaly.

31
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,578
We can use anomaly detection at the
Dynamic DNS service provider by examine

32
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:43,292
queries in DNS domains to
identify botnet CNC domains.

33
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:46,604
And once we identify a domain
is used for botnet CNC,

34
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:49,323
then a number of
responses are available.

35
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:52,165
One is for the service provider
to disable a domain, but

36
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:55,290
it's one thing to occur when
none such domain reply.

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,600
Another option is for

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,000
the provider to set a mapping
of a domain to a single address.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,880
So that instead of connecting to
the botnet command control server,

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,110
the bots are now
connected to a sinkhole.

41
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,820
The sinkhole in addition
to disabling the botnet

42
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,210
security researchers can also learn
where the bots are by looking at

43
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,400
the origins of the connections
to the sinkhole.
