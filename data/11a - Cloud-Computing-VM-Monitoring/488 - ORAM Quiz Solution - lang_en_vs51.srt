1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,990
The first statement, client must
have a private source of randomness.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,970
This is true, because the ORAM client
must generate random access patterns.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,470
The second statement,
data does not have to be encrypted,

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,270
since there's no access pattern.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,020
This is obviously wrong, because we want
to protect data from the cloud provider.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,160
Therefore, encryption is
actually the first requirement.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,064
The third statement each access to
the remote storage must have a read and

8
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:27,545
a write, this is correct.

9
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:31,943
Because we want to hide from core
providers the fact that we only reading

10
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:36,212
or writing data, therefore we will
include dummy reads and writes.
