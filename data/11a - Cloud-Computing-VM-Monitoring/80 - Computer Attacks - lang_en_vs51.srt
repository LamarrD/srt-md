00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,120
Now let's discuss social engineering
attacks that involves computers.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,550
The first kind is popup windows.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,550
For example, a popup window can
pretend to be a login window.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,620
This exploit will work if the users
have not been properly trained

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,840
to tell the difference between the fake
and the legitimate login windows.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,000
The attacker can also use IM or
IRC to fake a technical support desk.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,120
And the users would be redirected
to a malicious site and

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,360
malware can then be downloaded.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,880
An attacker can also check
the user to open an email and

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,770
download email attachment which
includes malicious software.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,380
There are many ways to
hide malicious programs

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,680
in email attachments that
may appear to be legitimate.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,060
For example, PDF files can
include executable macros and

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,240
a .exe file can be
camouflaged into a .doc file.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,260
And of course, we are familiar
with various kinds of email scams.

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,030
the attackers can amplify the effects
of email scams using chain emails.

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,220
For example, an email can be sent
to everybody on your address book.

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,950
An attacker can create a website
that claims to offer prizes but

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,430
require the user to create login and
passwords.

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,640
The goal of the attacker is
to harvest user credentials

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,130
since many users uses same username and
password on many websites.

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,420
The attacker can then use the
credentials obtained from his website

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,200
on other websites.
