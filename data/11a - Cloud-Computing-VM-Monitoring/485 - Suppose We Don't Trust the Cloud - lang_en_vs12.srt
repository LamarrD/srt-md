00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,300
Now let's discuss another data privacy
issue in the cloud environment.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,830
Suppose we don't trust
the cloud provider?

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,880
We can either encrypt our data
on the cloud storage server and

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,150
keep the keys to ourself.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,930
When we need to use the data,

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,530
we can fetch the encrypted
data to our environment,

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,600
encrypt the data, then use the
application in our local environment.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,010
The question is, is this efficient?

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,850
No, because the data access patterns
can still leak information,

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,570
such as what kind of computing
tasks are being performed.
