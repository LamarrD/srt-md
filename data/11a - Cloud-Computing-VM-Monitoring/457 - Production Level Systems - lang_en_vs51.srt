00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,290
Let's discuss memory monitoring and

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,920
analysis in a virtualization
environment.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,880
The security in a controlled
virtual machine are smaller,

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,200
because they can run a stripped down OS.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,810
The security machine
gets a raw memory view,

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,980
meaning that it has seized the physical
memory from the other virtual machines.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,330
If you want anything useful,

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,370
you need to rebuild the obstruction
levels on your own.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,351
And this is challenging, and
we will discuss this shortly.

10
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:25,986
There are several types of monitoring.

11
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:28,600
The first is passive monitoring.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,280
This means that the security virtual
machine takes a snapshot of view,

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,317
of the raw memory of a virtual machine.

14
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:36,770
The second type is active monitoring.

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,390
This means that the security virtual
machine takes a view of the memory of

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,490
another virtual machine,

17
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,520
when there's an event being
triggered at that virtual machine.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,190
An important goal of memory
monitoring is to locate

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,750
the important data structures in
memory for security analysis, for

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,860
example, examining the process list.
