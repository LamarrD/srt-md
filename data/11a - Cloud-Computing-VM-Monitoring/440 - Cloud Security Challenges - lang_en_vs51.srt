1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,010
Let's also summarize
the security challenges.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,600
First, we have to consider various
international privacy laws.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,850
For example, the Eu Data
Protection Directive and the U.S.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,350
Safe harbor program.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,110
And data can be subject to
subpoenas from government,

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,900
including a foreign government.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,120
And since multiple organizations may
be using the same cloud computing

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,110
environment, we need very
strong isolation protection.

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,010
And since computation and data can be
distributed log in becomes a challenge.

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,460
Similarly, since the cloud is
a distributed computing environment

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,630
it is challenging to provide
consistent quality of service.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,070
And finally, since the customer does
not own the computing environment

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,600
there could be potential
data ownership issues.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,210
For example, who owns the one time data
produced by a customer application?

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,840
There are additional challenges.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,820
These include, now we have to
depend on a secure hypervisor.

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,550
And, the cloud is an attractive
target to attackers.

18
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,290
And, we sill need the security
of the operating systems

19
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,920
running in the virtual machines.

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,890
And, the potential impact of
a successful attack on the cloud

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,100
can be massive.

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,280
And since some organizations
now start to use public cloud,

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,810
it is challenging to reconcile
the security policies

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,400
of the internal network
versus the public cloud.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,990
And for public cloud that uses
software as a service model,

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,800
a customer cannot control what
software or what version to use.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,370
It is obvious that we should protect
data security using encryption.

28
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,670
In particular, we need to encrypt
not only the data at rest, but

29
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,680
also access to resources
because otherwise

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,890
every service can learn about
the computing tasks being performed.
