00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:04,011
One of the most essential tasks of
virtual machine security is memory

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:04,682
analysis.

3
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:07,341
This is because memory is
the only reliable source

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,740
of the current state of a computer.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,610
For example,

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,720
using memory analysis we can find
out a list of the running processes.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,680
We can also find out the encryption
keys being used and the decrypted data.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,920
We can look at network socket and data.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,990
We can also find OS-level accounting
information, as well as user inputs.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,210
We can also read the screen captures and

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,540
find the graphical elements of
an application and so on and so forth.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,430
And these are just a few examples.
