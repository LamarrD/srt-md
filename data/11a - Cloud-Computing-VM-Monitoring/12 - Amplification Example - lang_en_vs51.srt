00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,290
Let's take a closer look
at amplification attacks.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,060
Typically, the attacker uses a machine,
and then these attacker machine

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,280
controls a number of bots,
or compromised computers.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,265
And each of these bots will send
many requests to a server, and

5
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:20,290
the response from the server is
much larger than the request.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,460
So the amplification is
accomplished by two factors.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,770
One is the number of bots involved.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,630
And second, the server response
is much larger than the requests.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,130
Here's a specific example
of amplification attack.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,970
This involves DNS,
the domain name system.

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,640
Here's the amplification factor
involving the server, the DNS server.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,840
So here we have the machine sending
a DnS request to the server.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,200
And of course, the address, the source
of the DnS query is spoofed and

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,410
the server thinks that
the request is from the target.

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,160
The server response is much
larger than the request.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,660
In this case, it is 50 times.

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,070
Here, EDNS means extension mechanism for
DNS.

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,110
It allows for actual flags and
response data.

19
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,775
Therefore, the response is much larger.

20
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:16,511
In a DNS-based amplification attack,
each of the bots controlled by

21
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:21,570
the attacker will send many requests
to any of the DNS resolvers.

22
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,960
And there are many of them.

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,140
And for each request,
the response will be sent to the target

24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,590
because in each request,
the source IP address is spoofed.

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,870
The attacker can choose any
subset of the DNS servers to use

26
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,390
because there are so
many open DNS resolvers on Internet.

27
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,950
This attack can generate
a huge amount of traffic

28
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,630
in a very short period of time.

29
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,090
For example,
the attacker can easily generate tens or

30
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,160
even hundreds of gigabits per second
traffic targeted at a victim.
