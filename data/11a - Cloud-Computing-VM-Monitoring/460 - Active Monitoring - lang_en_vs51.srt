Now, let's discuss active monitoring.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,960
Active monitoring is event driven which
allows for enforcing security policy and

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,980
stopping attacks before they happen.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,250
Here's an example of active monitoring.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,150
The security application receives event
notification from the guest virtual

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,640
machine when the code execution,
which is one of the hooks,

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,970
hooks invoke trampoline which transfer
the control to the security application.

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,900
The hooks in the associated code in
the guest virtual machine are protected

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,050
using the memory protection
provided by the hyperviser.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,030
Of course, when a security application
receives an event notification,

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,920
it's going to perform virtual
machine inspection, for

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,030
example, using the lip VMI.
