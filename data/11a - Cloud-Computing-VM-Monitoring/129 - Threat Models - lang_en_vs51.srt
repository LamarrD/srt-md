1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,640
Now let's discuss
the Web Security Threat Model.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,700
We use threat model to understand what
the web attackers are likely to do.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,870
And we're going to compare
the Web Security Threat Model and

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,320
the Network Security Threat Model.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,370
On the web, attacker can typically setup
a malicious website and the attacker

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,520
waits for users to visit the malicious
website so that the attack can be

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,360
launched through the malicious websites
to compromise the user's computers.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,140
A web attacker typically does
not control the network.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,880
Now let's look at
the Network Security Threat Model.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,890
A network attacker can
be much more active.

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,500
Typically, we would assume that
a network attacker can intercept and

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,010
control the network.

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,320
For example, the attacker can
intercept and drop the traffic.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,420
Or he can intercept and
perform traffic analysis

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,150
to crack open the encryption key to
read the data that's being transmitted.

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,660
Or he can inject malicious
traffic into the network.
