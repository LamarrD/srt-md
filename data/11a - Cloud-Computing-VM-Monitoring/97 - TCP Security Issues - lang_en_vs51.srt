00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,830
Now let's review some of the security
problems associated with TCP.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,440
Eavesdropping is always a big concern.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,610
And this is quite easy for

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,000
the attacker, if he can control your
router or the Wi-Fi access points.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,860
And such a hijacking is possible if
the attacker can learn the TCP state.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,890
And as discussed in our DDoS lesson, TCP
is subject to denial service attacks.
