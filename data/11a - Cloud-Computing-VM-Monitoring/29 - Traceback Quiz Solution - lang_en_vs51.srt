1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,019
Attackers can generate unlimited
types of packets, so this is false.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,210
Attackers can indeed work alone or
in groups.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,210
And the Traceback will work regardless
whether the attacker are aware of

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,990
the tracing mechanisms or not.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,090
So this is false.
