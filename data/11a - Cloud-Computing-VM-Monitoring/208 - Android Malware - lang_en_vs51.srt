1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,812
There is a large increase of
the number of Android malware and

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:06,530
the majority is still SMS Trojans.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,460
You can read more about current
Android malware at the link

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,290
in the instructor's notes.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,990
We discuss a few here.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,910
AccuTrack turns an Android
smartphone into a GPS tracker.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,430
Ackposts steals contact information.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,910
Acknetdoor opens a backdoor.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,960
Steek does fraudulent advertising and
also steals private information.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,920
Tapsnake posts the phone's current
location to a web service.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,580
ZertSecurity steals the user's
bank account information.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,810
Similarly, Zitmo also steals
the user's bank account information.

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,500
And there are many other more.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,070
Again, you can read more about
the current Android malware at the link

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,630
in the instructor's notes.

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,270
This plot summarizes the major
categories of Android malware and

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,370
their trends.

18
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,860
There are quite a few free Android
antivirus apps, here are a few examples.

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,000
The security companies own
statements provide some insights

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,220
of the state of anti
malware on mobile phones.

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,090
First of all,
the risk is relatively low.

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,810
In general, mobile devices are still
less powerful than desktops and

23
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,186
laptops and there are plenty of those
that can be targeted by hackers.

24
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:16,110
Furthermore, the [INAUDIBLE] process and
the sandbox space execution model

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,750
also means that the mobile devices
are in general more secure.

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,380
Nevertheless, there is still
the need to protect mobile devices.

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,550
In particular, in addition to
protection against malware,

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,970
a bigger problem is the loss of devices
and the loss or the theft of data.

29
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,620
And therefore secure companies also
try to protect and manage mobile data.

30
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,100
Mobile malware are becoming
more sophisticated and

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,450
are showing the same advanced features
of malware and laptops and desktops.

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,030
Here's an example of Android malware
that uses social engineering to spread.

33
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,049
It targets a group of activists.

34
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,659
On March 24, 2013,

35
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,719
the email account of a high-profile
Tibetan activist was hacked and

36
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,460
it was used to send spear phishing
emails to people on his contact lists.

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,150
This is what the spear
phishing email looked like.

38
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,390
The recipient of this email is tricked
that he should install this APK file

39
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,130
on his Android device
which is the malware.

40
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,920
After installation, an application named
Conference appears on the desktop.

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,310
After the installation, if the user
launches this Conference app,

42
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,660
he will be seeing the information
about the upcoming event.

43
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,900
While the victim reads
this fake message,

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,060
the malware secretly reports the
infection to a command control server.

45
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,100
After that, it begins to harvest
information stored on a device.

46
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,720
The stolen data includes contacts, call
logs, SMS messages, your location and

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,070
phone data, which includes phone number,
OS version, phone model, etc.

48
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,130
Know that the stolen data won't be
uploaded to the command control

49
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,460
center automatically.

50
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,560
The malware waits for

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,580
incoming SMS messages from
the command control center.

52
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,690
And based on the message,
the malware knows what data to upload.
