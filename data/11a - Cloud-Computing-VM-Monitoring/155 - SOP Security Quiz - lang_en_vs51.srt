1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,450
Now let's do a quiz on
the same origin policy.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,030
Given this website, for the requests
that are submitted from the following

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,300
URLs, which of these URLs will
result in a successful request, and

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,010
which will be rejected as not
being from the same origin?

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,850
Determine the outcome, success or
failure, for each URL.
