00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,630
To summarize what we
have discussed thus far.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,100
Let's go over the NIST cloud
definition framework, there are several

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,430
deployment models and each can
use one of these service models.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,850
Again, the deployment models include
Hybrid, Private, Community and

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,770
Public and the service models
include software as a service,

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,140
platform as a service and
infrastructure as a service.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,730
All Cloud environments share
some essential characteristics.

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,130
These include On Demand Self-Service,

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,310
Broad Network Access, Resource Pooling,
Rapid Elasticity, Measured Service.

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,020
And they also share some
common characteristics.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,170
This includes Massive Scale,
Homogeneity,

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,650
Virtualization, Low Cost Software,
Resilient Computing,

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,650
Geographic Distribution, Service
Orientation, and Advanced Security.
