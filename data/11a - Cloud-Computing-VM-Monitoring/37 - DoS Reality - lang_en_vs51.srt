So in summary,
denial of service attack is a real and

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,970
present danger on the Internet and

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,980
to mitigate such attacks, security must
be considered at Internet design time.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,085
Therefore, the sad truth is that
the current Internet is ill-equipped to

5
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,049
handle denial of service attacks.

6
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,800
There are some commercial solutions.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,388
There are many good proposals for

8
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:26,183
internet core redesign
such as based blogging.
