We perform experiments to
measure the overhead of SIM and

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,520
compare it with the out-of-VM
monitoring approach.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,010
And here are the results,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,240
we an see that SIM is much
faster than Out-of-VM approach.
