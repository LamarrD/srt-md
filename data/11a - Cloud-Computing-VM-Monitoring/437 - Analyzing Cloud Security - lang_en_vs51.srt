1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,460
There are several key security issues.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,270
For example,

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,435
how do we trust the cloud computing
environment because we don't manage it.

4
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:10,006
Furthermore, multiple different
organizations may be using the same

5
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:11,621
cloud computing environment.

6
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:13,895
And in terms of data protection,
obviously,

7
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,930
we should use encryption
to protect confidentiality.

8
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,030
But we also need to consider
various compliance issues.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,140
These security issues become very
challenging because the clouds

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,280
are massively complex systems.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,790
Although the primitives and
common functions are simple,

12
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,110
the complexity comes from the fact
that these primitives and

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,740
function units are replicated
thousands of times.

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,100
On the other hand,
as we will discuss shortly,

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,130
cloud security is a tractable problem
because there are both advantages and

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,020
challenges associated
with cloud computing.

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,520
Let's first discuss the advantages.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,700
First, you can put public data away
from the internal network to the cloud.

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,250
And it is easy to manage testing and
security patches when most systems

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,240
in a cloud computing environment
use the same software.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,900
And recovery is easy and fast because
it is easy to set up the same system.

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,690
But there are also challenges.

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,360
First, you have to trust
the cloud providers.

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,759
And you cannot respond to all
the findings, or investigate directly,

25
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,090
because you have to rely on the cloud
providers who are the direct admins, and

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,120
some software running in
the cloud is proprietary.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,960
And finally,

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,730
there is no physical control of
the computing resources that you use.
