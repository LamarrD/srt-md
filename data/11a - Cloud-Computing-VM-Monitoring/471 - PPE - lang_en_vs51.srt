1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,180
Property Preserving Encryption
is one way to protect data

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,460
while allowing application
to continue to work.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,600
And this approach is widely deployed
in various environments including

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,720
the Cloud.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,700
For example, Microsoft advertises
that data is always encrypted.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,010
On the other hand,
the applications continue to work.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,520
Property Preserving Encryption
has several advantages.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,730
There's no need to change
application and database servers,

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,840
it supports common data retrieval
methods, including SQL queries.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,970
It is reasonably efficient,
but what about security?

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,680
Although it widely believed that it is
secure, we should take a closer look.
