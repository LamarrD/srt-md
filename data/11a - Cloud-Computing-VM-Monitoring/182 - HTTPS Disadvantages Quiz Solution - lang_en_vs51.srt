1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,320
You need to buy an SSL certificate.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,680
Mixed modes issues, loading
insecure content on a secure site.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,020
This will continue to be
the problem until many,

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,010
many sites are all using HTTPS.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,360
Proxy caching problems,
public caching cannot occur.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,310
This is because all
traffic is encrypted, so

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,030
there's no public caching possible.
