00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,620
First, set the clipboard sharing
between the virtual machine and

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,082
the host to be bidirectional,
this is not safe.

3
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:10,641
Second, allow the VM to read and write
files on the host machine with the same

4
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:14,146
privilege as the host machine,
again, this is not safe.

5
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:18,189
This is similar to allowing an attacker
to write files on your machine.

6
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:21,882
The final statement, disconnect the
virtual machine from the internet when

7
00:00:21,882 --> 00:00:23,367
opening questionable files.

8
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:27,302
This is safe because this will prevent
potential malware from contacting its

9
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:28,640
command control server.
