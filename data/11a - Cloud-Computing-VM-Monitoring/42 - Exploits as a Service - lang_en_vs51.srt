1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,640
Now let's discuss a few
underground activities.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,790
The first is Exploits-as-a-Service.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,190
In the past, compromising
computer systems and use them for

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,410
profit are typically done by the same
criminal or criminals gangs.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,440
For example, the same criminal gangs
will develop their own exploits,

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,390
launch them, and then use
the hacked machines to make money.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,630
Nowadays the bad guys are specialized
and do different functions.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,450
For example, there are developers who
develop exploit kits and packets, and

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,560
sell them to other bad guys.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,880
And the other bad guys
are responsible for

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,010
using these exploit kits
to compromise computers.

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,380
For example, they can send out
spam with malware attachment.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,600
Or they can put the malware in
a compromised web servers, so

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,210
that when a victim's computer visit
those servers, they will be compromised.

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,760
These compromised computers are then
sold on the black market so that

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,950
other bad guys can use them to launch
malicious and fraudulent activities.

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,540
And the bad actors here are being
paid using the pay-per-install model.

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,030
Let's discuss exploits-as-a-service,
and in particular,

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,160
the pay-per-install
model in more details.

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,740
One way to distribute malware, or
causing computers to be compromised

21
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,200
by the malware, is through so
called drive-by-download.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,260
Basically a website is compromised to
have malware embedded in their scripts.

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,620
And then when a client
computer visits the website,

24
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,490
the malware will be
installed on their computer.

25
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,850
The number of exploit kits
that package the malware, and

26
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,650
install the malware on
the client computers.

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,170
There are two components in this
malware distribution model.

28
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,090
The first is that the bad guy needs
the exploit kit because the exploit kit

29
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,270
will be responsible for installing
the malware on the victim computers.

30
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,520
The bad guys can buy an exploit kit and
deploy it themselves.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,800
Or, they can simply rent
access to exploit server

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,790
that hosts the exploit kit.

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,000
In the first option,

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,250
the bad guy needs to figure out how to
distribute the malware themself, and

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,910
typically that means at least he has
to set up a server with exploit kits.

36
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,630
A more convenient option is for

37
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,950
the bad guy to rent access to a server
that already hosts an exploit kit.

38
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,350
The second component of this
malware distribution model is that

39
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,030
the bad guy needs to have the kind
computers visit the exploit server so

40
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,700
that malware will be
installed on these computers.

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,690
The most common way to accomplish
this is to use spam or

42
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,290
phishing to attract traffic
to this exploit server.

43
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,970
Traffic paper install simplifies
this malware dispersion process.

44
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,210
It essentially combine the two
elements into a single service.

45
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,860
And pay-per-install is now the most
popular way of distributing malware.
