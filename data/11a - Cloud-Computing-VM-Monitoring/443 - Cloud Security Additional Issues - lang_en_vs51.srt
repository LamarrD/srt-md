00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,530
There are some additional issues
associated with cloud security.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,400
In particular,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,200
we need to consider the privacy impact
when PII data is moved to the cloud.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,570
PII stands for
personal identifiable information, and

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,780
it is any data that could potentially
identify a specific individual.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,380
Customers should be aware that they need
to negotiate with the cloud providers to

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,380
obtain a security
service level agreement.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,510
But then we need to make sure that
we have proof that the service level

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,520
agreements have been satisfied.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,770
Obviously, a cloud provider needs
to plan for disaster recovery.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,960
In addition, a cloud provider needs to
consider a number of compliance issues.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,570
For example, HIPAA for healthcare
data and PCI for payment data.
