00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,480
Let's look at a traffic
paper install example.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,460
There are three causes of actors
in traffic paper install.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,020
There are the victims,
the exploit developers, and

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,260
the clients, or bad guys that use
the exploits to dispute malware.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,100
If you look at the traffic flow,
we notice that the payment flows from

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,270
the clients or the bad guys who buy or
rent the exploits to exploit developers.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,860
The malware flows from these
attackers to the victim.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,320
The payment amount depends on
the volume of malware installation.
