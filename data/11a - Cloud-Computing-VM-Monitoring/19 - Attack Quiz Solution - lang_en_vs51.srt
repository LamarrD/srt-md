1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,330
Attackers can obviously
spoof the IP address.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,790
The attack cannot be mitigated using
firewalls because the idea is that

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,070
the packets involved in the attack,
they all look legitimate.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,785
In addition, even if the firewall
is attempting to do filtering,

5
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:17,370
it itself is susceptible to flooding.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,470
The reason is that the firewall now
needs to examine many, many packets.
