1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,110
The question is can we have
both the security benefit

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,080
provided by virtual machine monitoring
which means out of VM monitoring and

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,190
the efficiency of traditional monitoring
which means In-VM monitoring.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,580
We have developed a secure
In-VM monitoring approach.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,060
We call this approach SIM for
secure In-VM monitoring.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,480
It provides the same security
as the out of VM approach.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,580
And its performance is similar to
the traditional In-VM approach,

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,850
the main idea is to use hardware
which virtualization features

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,670
to minimize the need to
switch to hypervisor.

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,420
In other words we can read or

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,820
write the memory of an untrusted
virtual machine at native speed.
