00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,370
The first statement, the attacker
needs to register a domain and

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,890
delegate it to a server under
his control, this is true.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,100
The second statement,

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,210
the attacker's server responds with
a short TTL record, this is true.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,310
The third statement,

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,040
a short TTL means that the page will
be quickly cached, this is false.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,060
The fourth statement, the attacker
exploits the same origin policy,

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,590
this is true.
