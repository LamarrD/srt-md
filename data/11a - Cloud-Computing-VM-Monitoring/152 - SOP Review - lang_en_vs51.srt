00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,019
Let's continue with a review
of Same Origin Policy.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,750
We have discussed
the Same Origin Policy for

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,450
DOM, which stand for
Document Object Model.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,070
The Same Origin Policy for
DOM says that origin A can access origin

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,079
B's DOM if A and B have the same
protocol, domain and port.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,540
In this lesson, we are going to discuss
the Same Origin Policy for cookies.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,320
Here, origin is determined by
the combination of scheme,

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,480
domain, and path, and
scheme can be optional
