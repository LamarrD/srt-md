00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,750
Recall that a network attacker can
control network infrastructures

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,350
such as routers and DNS servers.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,207
It can eavesdrop to learn traffic
contents, inject data, block traffic, or

4
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:14,460
even modify the contents.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,680
For example, such a network attacker
can sit at an internet cafe or

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,730
hotel lobby to compromise the network.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,490
HTTPS was designed to thwart
such network attackers.
