00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,010
The key to a botnet success is efficient
and robust command and control.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,190
And this is not always easy.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,970
The simplest,

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,870
most efficient way to perform command
control is through centralized control.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,930
For example through IRC command or

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,500
command, he can instruct
the bots to send spam.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,000
However this kind of command
control is not robust.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,930
Even though it's very efficient, because
it has a single point of failure.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,790
There's only one command
channel from the attacker.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,590
For example the IRC
channel can be taken down.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,080
Or the twitter account can be shut down.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,870
A more robust command control structure
is to use peer to peer network.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,960
Here, the botmaster can
connect to a number of bots

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,280
in this peer to peer network.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,630
And upload his commands,
and update to the malware.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,920
And make advertisements, so
that other bots can get the command and

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,620
updates from the peers.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,170
The drawback is that the botmaster
does not have direct

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,950
synchronized communication with autobot.

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,450
In fact, the Botmaster does not know how
many bots get it's commands and when.

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,250
Nowadays, the most popular approach for
command control is for

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,820
all the bots to connect to
a command control website.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,580
Obviously, this is very efficient.

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,360
And the Botmaster can make
this set up more robust.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,380
For example, the Botmaster can map this
website to different IP addresses.

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,430
The website is not always
fixed on one physical server.

27
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,810
It can be moved to different servers.

28
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,920
In fact, in Fast Flux, the Botmaster
can change the DNS IP mapping for

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,290
the website every ten seconds.

30
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,520
This can defeat detection or
blocking, based on IP addresses.

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,910
But since the domain
name is not changed,

32
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,400
this domain can still be detected as
using for botnet command control.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,050
And the ISPs can't block
access to this domain.

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,220
Instead of using fixed domains
that can be detected and blocked.

35
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,230
Botmaster's now used
random domain generation.

36
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,460
On each day, a bot will generate a large
number of random looking domain names

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,790
and lock them up.

38
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,460
The Botmaster will knows exactly
the same set of random domain each day.

39
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,970
Because each domains are generated
using the same algorithm.

40
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,650
And same random seeker seed
straight between the botmaster and

41
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,060
the bot malware.

42
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,380
In the botmaster, only register
a few of these random domains.

43
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,620
Although each bot generates many random
domain names, and look up each of them.

44
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,120
Only few of them will actually
connect to the websites.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,520
These are the sites that
are registered to the botmaster.

46
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,130
And of course, these sites can use fast
flux to move around on the internet.

47
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,490
By mapping to different IP
addresses every ten seconds.

48
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,230
This command and

49
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,430
control approach is very robust,
because it is hard for detection.

50
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,920
This is because each of these command
control domains are randomly looking.

51
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,850
And they're new.

52
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,320
And they are only used for
a very short period of time.

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,000
Say, one day.
