00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,560
Botnets can vary the CNC
communication patterns and

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,280
they can introduce random noise
in their communication traffic.

00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,170
For A-plane clustering, the botnets
can also vary their activities

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,060
to evade our detection heuristics.
