00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,330
HTTPS is integrated into a browser, or
it is indicated in the browser GUI.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,710
The goal is to let the user
know where a page came from.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,430
And it tells the users that the page
contents are protected, meaning that

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,970
they're encrypted so that a network
attacker cannot see them or modify them.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,080
In reality,
there are several security problems.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,570
When the lock icon is
displayed on the browser,

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,780
it means that all the elements on
the page are fetched using HTTPS.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,360
But for the browser to even
accept this HTTPS connection,

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,026
it means that the browser has
trusted the certificate and

10
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:39,280
verified that the certificate is valid.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,170
And also,
the domain URL matches the CommonName or

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,100
SubjectAlternativeName in
the certificate.

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,976
For example,

14
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:51,870
the certificate of google.com can simply
supply a list of alternative names.
