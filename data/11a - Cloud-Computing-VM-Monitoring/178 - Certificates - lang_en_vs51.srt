00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,810
An essential problem in
public key cryptography

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,820
is how Alice can obtain
the public key of Bob.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,710
The standard is to use certificate
issued by a certificate authority,

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,480
we call it the CA.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,720
First, every entity has
installed the public key of CA.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,780
Then Bob can ask the CA to generate
a certificate for his public key.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,090
The certificate authority keeps
the signing private key to itself.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,760
And again, the corresponding public key
has been installed in all entities.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,894
The CA signs Bob's public key
using it's signing private key and

10
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:38,470
the signature is put
into the certificate.

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,090
So Bob can now present
the certificate to Alice.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,700
And because Alice has the certificate
authority's public key,

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,190
she can verify that the signature
was constructed properly.

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,500
Which means that Bob's public
key has been certified

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,410
by the certificate authority.

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,390
Here's an example of
public key certificate.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,010
Let's go over some
important information.

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,740
First, there's a unique serial number.

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,290
Second, there's a valid time period.

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,510
And there's a public key and
a signature produced by the CA.

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,090
Here's an example of
certificate information

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,510
that a user sees on his computer.

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:20,770
It identifies that the certificate is
for the public key of mail.google.com.

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,730
A certificate is for an entity or

25
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,420
subject that is identified
by the common name.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,270
So what is a common name?

27
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,910
A common name can be an explicit name,
for example cc.gatech.edu.

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:38,700
Or it can be a wildcard,
for example, *.gatech.edu.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,500
If a wildcard is used it can
only be the leftmost component,

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,616
and it does not match dot.

31
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:50,171
For example: *.a.com matches

32
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:54,730
x.a.com but not y.x.a.com.

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,676
There are large numbers of CAs out
there, and a browser typically accepts

34
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:04,400
certificates from 60 top level CAs and
1200 intermediate CAs.
