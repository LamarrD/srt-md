1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,490
Let's go over the various types
of attackers in more details.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:10,050
For the web attacker, the attacker could
typically control a suspicious site,

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,340
say, attacker.com.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,980
He can even obtain certificate for
his website so

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,580
that the website can interact with
users' browsers through HTTPS.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,170
And then the attacker can wait for
the user to visit attacker.com.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,780
For example, this can be done through
phishing and other kinds of redirect.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,040
Or, the attacker can set up some
sort of malicious, or fake,

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,350
web app and wait for the user to
download these apps and run these apps.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,155
The point here is that, typically,
a web attacker is somewhat passive.

11
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:48,070
He sets up some attack
infrastructure and waits for

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,900
the users to actually either visit those
sites or use those malicious apps.

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,578
A network attacker is more powerful.

14
00:00:56,578 --> 00:01:00,898
He can perform both passive and
active attacks.

15
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:06,052
For example, a passive attack means
that the attacker simply intercepts and

16
00:01:06,052 --> 00:01:10,050
analyze traffic to learn
about the communication.

17
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,460
For example, the attacker can
perform wireless eavesdropping

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,820
to crack the encryption key for
you're Wi-Fi network.

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,780
Examples of active attacks
include inserting a malicious

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,020
router in the network so that traffic
can route through the router and

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,420
be subject to the attackers attack.

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,020
That includes both passive
like eavesdropping, or

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,130
active attacks such
as traffic injection.

24
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,780
Another example is DNS poisoning, where
the attacker changed the DNS entry so

25
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,080
that a legitimate site such as cnn.com,

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,650
now has an IP address of a server
that's controlled by the attacker.

27
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,870
That is, legitimate traffic such as
to cnn.com will not be redirected,

28
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,710
so that legitimate traffic such
as those to cnn.com will now

29
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,620
be redirected to the attacker's machine.

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,400
The most general and
powerful attack is through malware.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,110
By injecting a piece of malware
on the user's computer,

32
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,280
the attacker essentially escapes,
the browser's isolation mechanism.

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,290
And now,

34
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,550
has a program that runs directly under
the control of the operating system.

35
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,850
That is, the malware runs as any
other applications on your computer.

36
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,130
You may ask, why is that possible?

37
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,200
Isn't the browser supposed to isolate
the rest of the computer from the web?

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,010
The problem is that browser is a very
complex piece of software, and

39
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,130
as such, browsers may
contain exploitable bugs, and

40
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,450
these bugs often enable remote
execution of malicious code.

41
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,990
For example, when a browser visits a
site that's controlled by the attacker,

42
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,100
the attacker can send a webpage
that contains malicious input.

43
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,880
And the result is that a bug
is being exploited and

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,280
a piece of malicious software, or
malware, is now installed on a computer.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,620
Now, even if the browsers are bug free,
there are still lots of

46
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,890
vulnerabilities on the web,
in particular on the web-server side.

47
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,768
That would enable cross-site scripting,
SQL injection,

48
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:21,645
and cross-site request forgery.

49
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:26,069
For example, SQL injection
would allow the attacker to

50
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,362
bypass the control of the web server,
and

51
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:35,640
directly inject attackers' code into
the back end of the SQL database.

52
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,040
The point is that malware
attackers can actually bypass

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,830
the basic control of web,

54
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,920
including browser, to actually attack
the users' computers or the web service.

55
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,390
So we will discuss three
main types of attackers.

56
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,470
The malware attacker, the network
attacker, and the web attacker.

57
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,160
It is obvious that a web attacker

58
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,120
is the least lethal because
he's mostly passive.

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,530
A network attacker is more powerful
because he can perform both passive and

60
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,850
active attacks.

61
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,090
And a malware attacker
is the most lethal and

62
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,910
powerful because it can inject
code into a user's computer or

63
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,930
a server to perform any actions
desired by the attacker.
