1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,840
As illustrated in the previous example,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,000
querying the IP address of a domain
name can involve a number of steps.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
To save time, the records are cached
on a local server for reuse later.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,700
For example, when the IP address of
www.cc.gatech.edu has been obtained,

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,940
the mapping of this IP address and
the domain is cached so

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,430
that the next time the browser
is looking up www.cc.gatech.edu,

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,210
the DNS server does not have
to go out to look it up again

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,700
because the mapping is
already stored in the cache.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,890
Obviously, this saves time.

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,780
On the other hand, each record,
meaning the mapping of IP address and

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,500
domain that's being stored in the DNS
cache, has a TTL, or time-to-live.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,820
And, when this TTL expires,
the cache entry is invalid.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,889
Which means, if the browser
looks up www.cc.gatech.edu,

14
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:04,861
after the TTL of the cache entry
has expired, the DNS server,

15
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:07,937
then has to go out and look it up again.

16
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:11,059
TTL is useful because a server,

17
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:17,350
say www.cc.gatech.edu maybe
moved to a new IP address.

18
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,620
So, you want the TTL to expire, so
that the DNS servers can look up for

19
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,300
the new mapping.
