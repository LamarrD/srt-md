00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,740
What are the challenges
in botnet detection?

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,070
First of all bots try
to hide themselves.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,810
Second of all,

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,980
bots are also involved in multiple
activities over a period of time.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,750
Bot malware can also
get updates frequently.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,900
Botnets can have many different
command control methods.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,371
In fact, a bot malware can be
programmed to select one of several C&amp;C

8
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:22,070
methods at run time.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,230
So how do we go about detecting botnets?

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,250
We need to first focus on
the characteristics that botnets

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,130
are different from normal traffic.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,220
First of all, a bot is not a human.

13
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,490
That is, the activities by bots may look
different from the activities by human.

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,800
Second of all, the fact that
botnet is a network means that

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,970
the bots are connected, and their
activities are somehow coordinated.

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,500
We can also distinguish botnets
from other traditional attacks.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,910
Botnets are for profits, and

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,980
they most likely are going to use
the compromised computers as resources.

19
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,760
Botnets are for long-term use.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,300
And therefore there will be frequent
updates to the bot malware.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,230
And again there must be coordination
among the bots to form a botnet.

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,980
Let's first discuss how do we detect
botnets in the enterprise network.

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,230
We can deploy a botnet detection
system at a gateway or router.

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,710
This is how we deploy firewall in IDS.

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,990
There are several detection approaches
in a so called vertical correlation.

26
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,520
We are looking for
correlated events across a time horizon,

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,070
even if a bot has multiple
activities in its life cycle.

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,060
In horizontal correlation
we are looking for

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,500
similar or coordinated
behaviors across multiple bots.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,270
In cause and effect correlation,
we inject traffic to pay with the bot

31
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,540
to conform that the traffic is
generated by bot versus human.

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,810
In this lesson, we going to discuss
two systems, one is BotHunter,

33
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,399
the other one is BotMiner.
