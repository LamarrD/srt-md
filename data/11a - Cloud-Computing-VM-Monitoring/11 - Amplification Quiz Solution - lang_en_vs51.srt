1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,460
As we already discussed,
the volume of request from a computer

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,060
is smaller than the response
from the server.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,290
That means a small command can
generate a large response.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,030
And the attack works
because the attacker

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,140
can send the request to a server by
spoofing the IP address of the target.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,176
So that the servers response
is sent through target and

7
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:24,290
that's how the attack works.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,440
And it is difficult to ensure that
the computers only communicate

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,310
with legitimate NTP servers.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,250
This means that it is not easy to
figure out responses from NTP servers.
