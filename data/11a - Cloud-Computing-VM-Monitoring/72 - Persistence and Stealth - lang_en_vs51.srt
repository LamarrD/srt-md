1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,120
To simulate the modern attacks,
such as the so

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,380
called advanced persistent threats.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,470
Penetration testing can try
to be persistent and stealth.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,300
For example, the tester can install
a backdoor through a malware so

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,020
that there's a permanent
foothold in the network.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,210
The malware can be placed in
a strategic place such as a proxy.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,270
And the result can be that now
the malware can listen and

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,880
record all traffic within the network.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,089
And by analyzing internal traffic, the
malware can capture user credentials and

10
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,475
find out valuable information.

11
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:34,400
These steps can be iterated and

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,690
moved from one port of the network
to the next while hiding the tracks.
