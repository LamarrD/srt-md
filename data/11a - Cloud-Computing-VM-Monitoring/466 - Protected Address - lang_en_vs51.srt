1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,130
Let's compare the memory layout between
the SIM virtual address space and

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,180
a system virtual address space.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,990
As you can see the SIM code and

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,630
data cannot be viewed by
the untrusted system.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,140
The entry gate and
exit gate are executable in both spaces.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,959
Their security is provided by memory
protection in the hypervisor and

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:20,150
the invocation checker in SIM.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,810
The kernel code and data from the
untrusted system can be read directly

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,540
by SIMbut y SIM does not execute
such untrusted code and data.
