00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,784
The first time gaining access to
a network through an exploit is

2
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:05,010
always hard.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,900
And you want subsequent access
to be easy and look normal, so

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,720
you will create trap doors or
back doors.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,560
There are many techniques and tools.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,320
For example,
you can create fake user accounts, or

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,940
you can plant remote access services.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,785
You can also schedule your
activities at certain time.
