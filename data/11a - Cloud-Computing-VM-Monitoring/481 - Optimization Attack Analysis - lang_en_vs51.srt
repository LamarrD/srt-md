1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,890
Here are some results
of applying this attack

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,060
on the electronic Medical records.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,940
The x axis is the cumulative
fraction of records recovered, and

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,070
the y axis is the fraction of hospitals.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,690
That is, in all of this parts,
our point xy shows that

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,900
at least x fraction of records was
recovered for y fraction of hospitals.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,610
For example, for disease severity
at least 40% of the records

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,670
were recovered for 50% of the hospitals.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,180
The best result we can obtain
is that all records, for

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,540
all hospitals, were recovered.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,490
Here are the highlights of the results.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,260
For example, for

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,440
sex, 100% of the patients For
95% of the hospitals recovered.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,300
And for major diagnostic category,
40% of the patients for

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,920
28% of the hospitals were recovered.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,090
And we show more results
here the highlights are, for

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:53,862
age 10% of the patients for
85% of the hospitals were recovered.

18
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:57,510
For length of stay, 83% of the patients
for 50% of the hospitals were recovered
