00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,280
Underground forums are one
the entry points of the bad guy's

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,910
communication systems, especially for
those new to the underground.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,340
There are many underground
forums on the Internet.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,860
And they're just one search and
one click away.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,660
And there are a large number
of illicit activities

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,220
being advertised on these forums.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,780
Obviously law enforcements are watching
and can shut down these sites.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,240
However, new forums can always
pop up and fill the void.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,130
These forums also provide valuable
data sources to researchers.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,730
For example, researchers can study
the data to learn about new trends and

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,920
detect unfolding attacks.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,360
The forums are full of buyers,
sellers, and the rippers.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,820
There are honest deal makings but
there are also rip-offs of the buyers.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,380
Basically, these forums are as regulated
as what administrators can handle.

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,740
Most messages on the forums
are just advertisements.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,743
For example, one can advertise that
he has stolen bank accounts or

17
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:04,810
access to computers or email lists.

18
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,610
One can ask for

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,950
stolen credit card numbers in exchange
for access to a hacked LINIX machine.

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,730
Many of these advertisements
include evidence

21
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,690
of the advertisers capabilities.

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,940
For example, to demonstrate that
the stolen accounts are valid or

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,550
show a sample of the stolen information.

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,920
Again, the forum is typically
useful just advertisement.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,220
The actual due-making is typically
done via private messaging.
