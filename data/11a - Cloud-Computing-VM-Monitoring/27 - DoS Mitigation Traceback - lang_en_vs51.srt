1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,800
Now let's discuss another
source identification technique

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,060
called Traceback.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,570
The goal is that given a set of attack
packets, we want to determine the paths

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,520
of these packets and use a path to
determine the source of these packets.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,750
And the way to do this is to change
the Internet routers to record

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,610
some path information into the packet.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,370
There are a few assumptions here.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,410
First, most the routers
remain uncompromised,

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,350
meaning that these routers can
record information faithfully.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,340
Second, the attackers send many packets,
and

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,260
the route from the attackers source to
the victim remains relatively stable.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,640
Here's a naive strawman method.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,580
We can have each router at its
own IP address in the packet.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,270
So, at the end, the victim can
read a path from the packet

15
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,450
because each router has
written its own IP address.

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,109
The problem with this is that
it requires space in packet and

17
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:58,606
this can be a problem
when a path is long.

18
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:02,615
There's no extra fields in the current
IP format to record this whole

19
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:04,260
path information.

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,830
If we expect the packet format
to be changed to include this

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,550
path information it would take years,
if ever, to get this implemented.

22
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,014
So here's a better idea.

23
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:17,423
We observe that the non-service
attack involve many,

24
00:01:17,423 --> 00:01:21,991
many packets on a same path, so we can
have each router to take a probability

25
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:24,860
to store its own address in a packet.

26
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,340
This required only a fixed amount of
space regardless of the path length.
