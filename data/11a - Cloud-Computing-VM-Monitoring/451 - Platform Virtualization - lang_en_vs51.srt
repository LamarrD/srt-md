00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,860
The most important technology for
cloud computing is virtualization.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,689
This is because cloud computing
relies on separating applications

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,490
from the underlying infrastructure.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,978
The key to virtualization
is the hypervisor or

5
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:15,697
the virtual machine monitor in
addition to increased utilization.

6
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:19,022
For example running many virtual
machines on a single hardware,

7
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:22,780
virtualization can also improve
security and we will discuss this next.
