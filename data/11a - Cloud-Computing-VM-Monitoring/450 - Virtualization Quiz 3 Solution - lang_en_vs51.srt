1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,100
Which one does not have
any host operating system

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,460
because they are installed
on a bare system?

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,360
That's a Type 1 hypervisor.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,950
Here, notice that the operating
system runs in a virtual machine

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,690
on top of the hypervisor.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,610
Second question.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,960
Which one emulates the devices with
which a system normally interacts?

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,740
That's the Type 2 hypervisor.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,260
Here, the hypervisor
emulates the hardware.
