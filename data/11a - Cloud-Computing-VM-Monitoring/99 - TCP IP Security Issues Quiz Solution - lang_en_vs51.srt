1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,910
The first statement, application layer
controls can protect application data,

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,130
and IP addresses,
this statement is false.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,070
IP addresses exist in a lower layer,
and so

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,010
application layer controls
cannot protect IP addresses.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,230
The second statement,

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,480
IP information cannot be protect by
transport layer controls, this is true.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,700
The third statement, network layer
controls can protect the data within

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,870
the packets as well as the IP
information for each packet.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,990
This statement's true,

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,860
because that is what network layer
controls are supposed to do.

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,170
The fourth statement,

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,920
data link layer controls can protect
connections comprised of multiple links.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,630
This is false, they cannot protect
connections with multiple links.
