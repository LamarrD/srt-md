00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,420
A promising approach to eliminate this
kind of leakage is to use oblivious RAM,

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,330
or ORAM.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,540
ORAM can hide access patterns.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,850
The main idea is that using ORAM, while
the cloud provider can still observe

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,850
data access, the access patterns are
independent of the actual data requests.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,890
Some of the main techniques
include O data access

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,110
operating on fixed size data blocks.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,950
The data is encrypted, not using
property preserving encryption.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,950
In addition, ORAM also use dummy
accesses, or re-encrypt data and

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,270
shuffle data around.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,590
Here's a high level pictorial
example of ORAM at work.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,550
The application needs to
access confidential data

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,790
such as getting an encryption key,
encrypt and store data, and

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,290
getting another encryption key.

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,750
For each of these access requests,

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,610
there are multiple requests
to the cloud server.

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,060
These requests all fixed
sized data objects, and

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,710
they are both read and writes.

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,190
That is, regardless whether
the original request is for read or

20
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,760
write, the actual dummy accesses
include both read and writes.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,349
And the data objects
are all of fixed size and

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,270
not distinguishable from each other.

23
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,880
And this is how you hide the access
pattern from the cloud provider.

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,150
ORAM is an active research area, and

25
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,460
if you are interested,
here are some papers.
