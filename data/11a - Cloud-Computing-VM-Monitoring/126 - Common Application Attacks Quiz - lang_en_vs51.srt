00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,740
Before we discuss web security,

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,190
let's remind ourselves as to
why we need web security.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,040
In this quiz,
match the attacks to their descriptions.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,870
So the attacks are, using components
with known vulnerabilities,

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,780
missing function level access control,
sensitive data exposure,

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,260
security misconfiguration,
insecure direct object references,

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:33,530
cross site scripting, broken
authentication and session, injection.

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,930
And the descriptions are, modifies
back-end statement through user input,

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:45,570
inserts Javaccripts into trusted sites,
program flaws allow bypass

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,190
of authentication methods,
attackers modify file names,

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,840
abuses the lack of data encryption,
exploits misconfigured servers,

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,450
privilege functionality is hidden rather
than enforced through access controls,

13
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,080
uses unpatched third party components.
