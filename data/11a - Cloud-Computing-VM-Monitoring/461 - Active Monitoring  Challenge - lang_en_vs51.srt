1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,890
There are several challenges
emerge in machine monitoring.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,890
The first is high overhead.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,980
The overhead comes from several sources.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,800
The first is invocation.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,020
Switching from a virtual machine to
the hypervisor into a virtual machine

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,300
is very expensive.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,950
The second source overhead
is introspection.

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,950
Again, accessing the memory
of another virtual machine

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,530
requires calls to the hypervisor.
