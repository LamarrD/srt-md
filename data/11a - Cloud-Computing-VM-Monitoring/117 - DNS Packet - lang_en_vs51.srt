1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,510
Now let's take a closer look at
the internals of DNS query and response.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,550
Let's start with the format
of a DNS packet.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,820
There is the usual IP header.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,940
There's a UDP header
because DNS uses UDP, and

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,130
the UDP payload is the actual DNS data.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,220
One of the most important fields
in DNS data is the query ID,

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,930
which is a 16 bit random value.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,690
A DNS query contains a query ID.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,090
And a response also carries the ID.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,510
Therefore, even though a DNS
server may send out many, many

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,592
queries at the same time, it can use
the ID to link a response to a query.

12
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:43,900
That is, the response to a query will
have the same ID of the query ID

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,390
of the original query.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,490
Now, let's look through an example.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,260
Suppose a local DNS
server is looking up for

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,380
the domain www.unixvis.net
on behalf of a browser.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,780
So, this is the local DNS server.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,860
It's going to send the query
to one of the root service.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,030
It sent a flag to say recursion desired.

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,040
That means it's asking the destination
DNS server to perform recursive queries

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,410
on its behalf.

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,070
Here is the response
from the root server.

23
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,830
The root server does not know
the IP address of www.unixwiz.net.

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,200
So it provides the IP addresses
of the next NS service.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,390
And these are called glue records.

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,360
Let's look at this in more detail.

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,220
The response comes from the root server,
back to the local DNS server.

28
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,820
It says that it's a response, the root
server does not know the IP address

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,620
of www.unixwiz.net, but
it knows where to ask.

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,470
It responds with a series of
NS records that should know

31
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,770
how to handle the original query.

32
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,130
Notice that both the domain names and

33
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,910
IP addresses of these named
servers are provided.

34
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,360
Because this response is not the final
answer to the original query,

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,830
it sets this flag to zero to indicate
that this is not authoritative.

36
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,770
And also because the root server
is busy, it's not going to perform

37
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,229
because of queries on behalf
of the local DNS server.

38
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,360
That's why it sets this flag to
indicate that it's not going to perform

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,590
because of queries.

40
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,570
That is, the local DNS server should
contact these named servers instead.

41
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,089
The final, or authoritative,
response comes from the named server,

42
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:25,679
linux.unixwiz.net.

43
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:30,040
And notice that now
the authoritative flag is set to 1.

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,245
Notice that this final response
contains the IP address of the domain

45
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:40,790
www.unixwiz.net, which is the domain
name contained in the original query.

46
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,170
And the TTL is one hour, which means
this record will be cached and

47
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,020
be valid for one hour.

48
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,900
And since these NS records are in the
same second level domain, unixwiz.net,

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,810
of the original queried domain,
they are also cached.
