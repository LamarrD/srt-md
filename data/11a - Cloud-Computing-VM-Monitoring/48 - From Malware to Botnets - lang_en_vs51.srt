00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,130
So we have just discussed how
malware can be distributed and

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,340
installed on victim's computers.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,410
These infected computers
are valuable resources.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,830
For example, they have a unique
IP addresses and bandwidth, and

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,500
they're typically distributed
across the internet.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,470
And they have spare CPU cycles that can
perform a wide range of activities.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,490
From attackers point of view
he wants to control and

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,530
utilize these infected machines and

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,270
the way to do this is to turn
the compromised computers into a Botnet.

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,230
The bad guy or the botmonster will
need a command control infrastructure

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,610
to control the bots.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,950
For example he can then ask the bot to
update its malware or can send commands

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,260
to the bots to launch synchronised
activities and the botnet can rent it

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,870
out to other bad guys to launch their
activities, such as sending spams.

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,180
Once in place,
the botnet now becomes a platform

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,660
to launch any number of malicious and
fraudulent activities.
