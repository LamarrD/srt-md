1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
Let's review why malware is
such a big security problem.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,460
It is very easy for
malware to get on a user's computer.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,170
Say a user browses the web, for example,
reading the news at USAToday.com.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,050
And this may result in
a compromise to his computer.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,990
The reason is that USAToday.com's
ad network can be compromised, so

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,730
when they use their
browsers usatoday.com,

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,070
his browser will be served
with malicious JavaScript.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,610
And of course, this script is bundled
with ad and this malicious JavaScript

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,550
will automatically direct the user's
browser to a rogue AV website.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,260
Rogue AV stands for
rogue antivirus software.

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,930
The end result is that the user's
tricked to download a rogue AV,

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,930
which is actually a malware.

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,060
Here's a case study on how many
sites may have been compromised and

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,240
serve malicious contents.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,530
The researchers analyzed
the Alexa top ranked domains.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,400
They allowed 252 million domains
worldwide in 2016 at this time.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,260
A research system was created to examine
Alexa top 25,000 domains each day.

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,790
Essentially the browser within a virtual
machine is forced to visit each domain.

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,850
A research system was created to examine
Alexa's Top 25,500 domains each day.

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,940
Essentially, the browser
within the virtual machine

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,970
is forced to visit domain.

22
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,060
The network traffic that follows
a visit to these websites

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,190
are analyzed to determine whether
drive by download had occurred.

24
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:42,190
The result show that 39 domains
resulted in drive by download.

25
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:48,020
And among these, 87% of these sites
involved exploits of JavaScripts.

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,130
And 46% of these sites served
the exploits through ad networks.

27
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,698
From Alexa statistics, about 7.5
million users visited these 39 sites.

28
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:03,500
And about 1.2 million user computers
are likely compromised because

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,090
these computers don't
have adequate defenses.

30
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,979
For example, they have out of
date antimalware software.

31
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,150
Collectively the attackers
always develop new malware and

32
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,990
new ways to spread malware widely.

33
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,890
For example,

34
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,340
an exploit was developed on mobility
in Acrobat Reader's Flash interpreter.

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,200
As defenders we may discover
that one of our user's computers

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,510
was compromised by this exploit.

37
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,360
For example,

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,750
we may be able to observe the phone home
traffic from the compromised computer.

39
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,790
That is we may observe
the command control traffic.

40
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,560
From the compromised computer.

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,580
And the chances are our user is not
alone because we may soon discover that

42
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,710
many websites are hosting
the same kind of exploits.

43
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,450
This is indeed the real case.

44
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,080
And of course,
users remain the weakest link and

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,530
often they are subject to
social engineering attacks.

46
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,380
For example, a very compelling email may
make a user click on an active content.

47
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,280
For example a video or flash content.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,430
That result in a compromise
such as this real case.
