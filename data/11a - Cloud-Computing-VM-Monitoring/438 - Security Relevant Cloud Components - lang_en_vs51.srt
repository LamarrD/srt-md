00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,930
All the core components of
a cloud computing environment

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,370
are relevant to security.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,170
This include cloud provisioning
services, cloud data storage services,

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,560
cloud processing infrastructure, cloud
support services, cloud network and

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,090
perimeter security and

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,890
elastic elements: Storage,
processing and virtual networks.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,270
Now, let's discuss
the security advantages and

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,060
challenges for
each of these core components.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,333
The first is provisioning services.

10
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,565
There are several security advantages.

11
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:31,920
This include,
rapid reconstitution of services.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,200
Greater data availability because we
can provision multiple data centers and

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,250
advanced honeynet capabilities.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,210
The main security challenge is that, if
the provisioning service is compromised,

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,160
the impact is disruptive.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,130
For data storage services,
there are several security advantages.

17
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,936
This include data can be fragmented and
dispersed, therefore,

18
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:54,230
data can be more resilient to attacks.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,920
In addition, data can be
encrypted at rest and in transit.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,170
There's also automatic backup and
replication of data.

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,640
But, there are also several
security challenges.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,410
For example,

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,300
data from multiple organizations may
be put in the same storage server.

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,180
And, the storage server may
be in a different country.

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,910
For the cloud processing infrastructure,
the main security advantage is that

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,520
we can secure the master
copy of a program and

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,290
then, replicate that copy throughout
the cloud computing environment.

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,880
But then, there's also several
security challenges, for

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,590
example, multiple applications can be
running on the same physical machine.

30
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,770
And therefore,
achieving a real isolation is not easy.

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,340
For example, cash and memory access are
side channels that can leak information.

32
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,410
And of course,
we'd assume that the hypervisors or

33
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,740
the by virtual monitors are secure.

34
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,070
Cloud Support Services can provide
on demand security controls for

35
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,300
customer applications.

36
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,830
But now, the cloud providers need to
make sure that customer applications

37
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,990
will not cause security problems
in the cloud environment.

38
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,140
In terms of networks security, since the
computing systems are now distributed,

39
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,030
denial of service attacks
are now harder to succeed.

40
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,010
Furthermore, standard perimeter
security measures such as IDS and

41
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,270
firewalls are deployed by default.

42
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,070
But since different applications
share the same cloud,

43
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,330
it is challenging to create
security zones where the resources

44
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,090
share a common security exposure or
security risk.
