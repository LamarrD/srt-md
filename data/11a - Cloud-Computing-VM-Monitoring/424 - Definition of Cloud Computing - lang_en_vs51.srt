00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,860
First, let's go over
the definition of cloud computing.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,270
Cloud computing is a model for
enabling convenient, on-demand

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,630
network access to a shared pool of
configurable computing resources.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,930
For example networks, servers,
storage, applications, and services.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,270
What this definition says is that, cloud
computing uses resources that can be

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,870
rapidly provisioned and
require low management overhead.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,020
Please note that the cloud
computing industry represents

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,600
a large ecosystem of many models,
vendors, and markets.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,150
And therefore our definition
here is very general.
