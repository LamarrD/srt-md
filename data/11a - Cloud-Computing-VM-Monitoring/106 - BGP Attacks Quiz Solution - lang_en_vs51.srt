1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,550
Denial of service attack.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,440
The attacker hacks the routing table and
either adds a false route or

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,950
kills a legitimate one.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,760
Sniffing.

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,570
An attacker needs to control a device
along the communication route.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,200
To do this, the attacker can BGP to
detour traffic through a malicious site.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,930
Routing to endpoints
in malicious networks.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,900
This requires that the attacker
redirect traffic away

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,150
from a legitimate host to
an attacker-controlled site.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,340
Creating route instabilities.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,560
This has not been
exploited by attackers yet.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,310
These instabilities
are too unpredictable and

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,500
can cause attacker to be
affected by their own attack.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,842
However, there is a possibility
that script kiddies

15
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,740
could begin to exploit them.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,070
Revelation of network topologies.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,000
This begins with attacker gaining
access to the routing table and

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,040
can, with patience, discover
the peer relations among the ASs.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,410
Now let's discuss some solutions
to the BGP security issues.

20
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,560
One solution is around PKI,
or Public Key Infrastructure.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,900
Here, each AS obtains
a certificate to certify each

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,850
route origination authority from
the regional Internet register, and

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,300
then attach the ROA to
path advertisement.

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,270
Essentially, each AS that advertise
a path is a route origination authority.

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,246
Another solution is to use SBGP.

26
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:29,330
The main idea here is to sign
every hop of a path advertisement.
