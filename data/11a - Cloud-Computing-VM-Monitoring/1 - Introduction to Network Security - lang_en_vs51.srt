00:00:09,488 --> 00:00:11,480
Welcome to Network Security.

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,730
When we think about network security, we
need to think about ways we can protect

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,160
our most valuable network assets,
data, and access to the data.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,800
We need to protect it from misuse,
authorized modification, and

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,940
destruction.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,420
We need to make sure assets
is restricted only to those

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,860
who are granted access.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,420
Sun Tzu said in the Art of War,
Know thy self, know thy enemy.

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,130
A thousand battles and
a thousand victories.

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,770
Now that may seem a little extreme but
it is not.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,330
We are at war.

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,360
Our enemies are hackers, scammers,
and script kitties off the internet.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,110
The battlefield is our networks and
the price is our data.

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,800
Network security requires us to use
all hardware and software means

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,510
at our disposal to protect our assets
and to effectively deploy them.

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,410
In this course, we're going to learn
about our enemies, their motivations,

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,190
methods, and attacks.

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,990
We also going to investigate how
defensive weapons and counter attacks.

19
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,600
Once you have completed this course, you
will have a clear understanding of who,

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,590
how, and hopefully even why
our networks are under attack.

21
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,850
And what you must do to prevent or
at least minimize the damage.
