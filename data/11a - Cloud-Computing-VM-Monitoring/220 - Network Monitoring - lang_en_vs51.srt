00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:04,670
The goal of network monitoring is to
detect and prevent attack traffic.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,720
Attack traffic used to be obvious.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,430
For example, the payload of a packet may
contain exploit to a known vulnerability

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,670
and therefore a signature can
be used to detect such attack.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,230
Or a network monitor can detect,
deny a service attack or

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,270
spam activity by analyzing the volume
and rate of network traffic.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,130
The typical network monitoring
systems are the firewalls and

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,350
the network intrusion detection systems.

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,720
Increasingly, the traditional
firewalls and

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,380
network IDS are becoming less effective.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,410
First of all,
mobile devices are now widely used.

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,070
A mobile device can be compromised
when an employee is on travel.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,110
And then when the employee
brings the mobile device into

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,250
the company's network, it effectively
has bypassed the perimeter defense.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,300
In addition,
attack traffic now is very subtle and

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,210
they often look like normal traffic.

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,720
For example,
botnet HTTP-based command and

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,130
control traffic would look like
normal legitimate web traffic.

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,010
Therefore, we need more advanced
network monitoring systems to detect

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,010
this new generation of attacks.

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,920
In this lesson, we're going to
discuss botnet detection systems.
