00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,130
In property preserving encryption,
some selective

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,090
properties of the alternate data
are preserved, such as the order.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,620
Searchable encryption means that
the encrypted data can be searched

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,610
using the encrypted keywords.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,080
In secure computation,

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,930
multiple parties can compute a function
using inputs that are kept private.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,950
In Homomorphic encryption, computations
performed directly on encrypted data,

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,630
have the same result as
the computations on the plaintext.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,850
In functional encryption,
the possession of a secret key

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,030
will allow someone to learn
the function that is being encrypted.
