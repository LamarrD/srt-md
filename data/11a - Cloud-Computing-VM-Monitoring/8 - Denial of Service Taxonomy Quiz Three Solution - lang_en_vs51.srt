1
00:00:00,598 --> 00:00:04,360
If the denial-of-service attack
targets server application,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,050
it means that the target is a specific
application on a target server.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,470
If the target is Network Access, that
means the attack is used to overload or

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,580
crash the communication
mechanism of a network, so

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,130
that Network Access now is unavailable.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,630
If the target is Infrastructure,
that means the attack is aimed at

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,410
the crucial services of the global
Internet, for example, the core routers.
