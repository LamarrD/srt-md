00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,040
As we have discussed,
the DNS responses and

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,970
in particular,
the mapping between the IP address and

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,610
a domain are cached so that we can
save time on repeated queries.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,960
The NS records of
the domains are also cached.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,942
Therefore, if the browser
looks up www.ece.gatech.edu,

6
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:25,146
the local DNS server only needs to start
with gatech.edu instead of the root.

7
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:31,470
DNS servers can also cache the negative
results such as a domain does not exist.

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,230
For example, if somebody misspelled
gatech.edu to say gatech.ed,

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,200
the DNS query response will be
this domain does not exist.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,050
And this result is cached.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,665
So that, next time if somebody
mistype again the same way,

12
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:50,150
gatech.ed, the DNS cache can always say,

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,650
hey this domain does not exist,
without having to query it.

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,440
And all cache data, whether it's
positive or negative response has a TTL.
