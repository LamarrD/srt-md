1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,760
First, anything changed or created is
not visible beyond its boundaries.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,260
This can apply to both sandboxes and
virtual machines.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,610
Sandboxes will isolate applications so
that other applications cannot see it.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,820
To see changes in virtual machines
you must be in the virtual machine.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,288
Second, if data is not saved,
it is lost when the application closes.

6
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:29,370
This is an advantage of sandbox.

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,369
And you can call it a security
strength of the sandbox

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,710
because any malware
downloaded will not be saved.

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,330
Third, virtual machines have their own
copies of complete operating systems.

10
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,920
There can be multiple operating
systems on a single hardware platform.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,770
Four, sandbox is lightweight and
easy to set up.

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,200
Fifth, for virtual machines, disc space
must be allocated to the application.
