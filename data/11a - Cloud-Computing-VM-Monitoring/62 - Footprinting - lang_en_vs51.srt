00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,230
Now, let's discuss these
steps in more details.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,370
The first step is footprinting.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,320
In this step, the attacker, or
tester, conducts reconnaissance and

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,760
information gathering.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,293
The important network information
includes network IP addresses,

6
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:18,120
the namespace, and topology.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,630
Even a phone number range can be used
for modem access or social engineering.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,580
Such information is critical for

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,820
planning the next steps of testing or
attacks.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,380
Example, you will need the IP addresses
to decide how to scan the network.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,870
Here we'll list the different techniques
and the corresponding tools for

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,990
footprinting.

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,050
For example, you can use Google to
find out the company information, and

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,590
use Whois to find out the domain name
information of the name servers and

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,410
IP ranges.
