1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,560
HTTPS is essentially HTTP over SSL,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,620
the secure socket layer, which is now
called TLS, transport layer security.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,530
With HTTPS,
all traffic between a web browser and

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,820
a web site is encrypted,
whereas HTTP is a clear text protocol,

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,970
meaning that the traffic
is not encrypted.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:29,530
For example, using HTTP, a user sends
a password and a web server receives it.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,410
Since the traffic data is in clear text,
a network attacker with access to

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,870
the link can intercept the traffic
data and learn the user's password.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,830
Now with HTTPS,
the user still sends the password, but

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,690
the password is encrypted
in transmission.

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,555
Therefore, even when
attacker can access a link,

12
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:52,710
he cannot learn your
clear text password.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,860
In summary, HTTPS allows for

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,640
secure communication over untrusted or
public network.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,489
It encrypts traffic and uses public key
to authenticate the web server and.

16
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,510
if possible.

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,880
even the browser.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Even if only the web service
public key is known,

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,960
many in the man-in-the-middle-attack
can still be prevented.

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,960
With all these benefits,
HTTPS is not used for all web traffic.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,720
The reason is that crypto operations
can slow down the web service,

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,880
in particular,
if it is not implemented right.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,250
And some ad networks,
do not support HTTPS.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,200
For example,

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,270
the ad publishers cannot learn the web
contents as being viewed by the users.

26
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,270
On the other hand,

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,450
Google is now trying to encourage
websites from adopting HTTPS.
