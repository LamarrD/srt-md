1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,670
In 2012,
some of these scammers got breached and

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,470
their data were dumped and
made publicly available.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,730
The data contained complete
logs of sales, customers, and

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,520
affiliate relationships.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,940
So researchers study this data and
publish their findings in this paper.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,090
Here's a look at the transaction
volumes per week for these scammers.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,870
We can see that these scammers
were around for a long time.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,760
We can see here that
the repeat customers or

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,270
the repeat orders are an important
part of the business.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,150
This data presents a counter-point
to the conventional wisdom

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,020
that online pharmacies are pure scams.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,320
They don't simply take credit card and
either never providing goods, or

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,620
providing goods of no quality.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,580
Because if that is true,
then we would not see repeat customers.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,080
Here's a breakdown of
the different types of drugs

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,370
being purchased by customers.

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,472
Here we see that pharma scams
bring in a lot of revenue,

18
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:00,370
but there are also a lot of costs.

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,319
The actual net revenue,
or profit is not huge.

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,460
These costs include
payment to the affiliates.

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,360
Cost of the network infrastructure,
and payment to spammers and

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,300
botnet operators.
