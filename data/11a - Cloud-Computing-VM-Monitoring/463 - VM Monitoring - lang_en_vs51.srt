00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's analyze the requirements of SIM.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,970
We want the invocation
to be really fast.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,090
This means that there's no
need to switch to hypervisor.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,170
We also want data read and
write at native speed.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,433
This means that we can
rewrite data directly,

6
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:15,239
without going through hypervisor.
