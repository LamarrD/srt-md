00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,028
Now let's discuss Web Worker.

2
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:07,250
Web Workers were ultimately not
intended for security, but they help

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,725
improve security because they allow
JavaScript to run in isolated threads.

4
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:16,550
Here's an example of how
do you create a Web Worker.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,588
Again, it is loaded from JavaScript.

6
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:24,464
A Web Worker has the same origin
as the frame that creates it, but

7
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:26,464
the Web Worker has no DOM.

8
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:29,097
It can communicate using postMessage.

9
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:30,960
So here's a simple example.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,028
The main thread, meaning the main
iframe thread, creates a worker.

11
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:39,810
It then starts the worker thread by
sending a message using postMessage.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,290
And here the worker
actually performs the work.
