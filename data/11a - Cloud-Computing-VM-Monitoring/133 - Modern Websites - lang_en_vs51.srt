00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,517
Before we go into
the details of web security,

2
00:00:03,517 --> 00:00:06,633
let's understand how
the modern web works.

3
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:11,502
For typical website, it contains
both static and active contents.

4
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:15,834
The active contents, or the code,
can be from many sources and

5
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:18,690
they can be combined in many ways.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,088
Then the security challenges are we
have many different types of data and

7
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:25,530
codes for many different sources.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,080
And they run and
interact with each other.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,940
For example,
on a typical web page we have code or

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,890
data related to the page itself,
the third-party API's, for

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,800
example to tutor, third-party
libraries to how you navigate and

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,520
scripts that run advertising contents.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,620
And the data and codes on a website
can be from many different sources,

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,300
by many different developers.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,300
For example,

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,670
a website can have many parties
contributing to its data and code.

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,860
These include page developers,
library developers,

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,295
service providers, data providers,
ad providers, and other users,

19
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:12,928
and extension developers,
such as the web app developers and

20
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:17,430
the CDN's,
the content distribution networks.

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,030
Obviously these parties can be from
different vendors and companies.

22
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,390
So the basic security questions are with
data and codes from so many different

23
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,130
sources, how do we ensure data And
integrity when we browse the web?

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,650
For example, we need to figure out
how to protect page from ads and

25
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,940
services because they
are from different sources.

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,120
On the other hand, maybe there's
a legitimate reason to share data

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,290
when they are from different sources.

28
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,670
That is, how do we share data
with cross-origin page and

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,340
how do we protect one user
from another user's content?

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,670
How do we protect the page
from a third-party library?

31
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,300
How do we protect a page from
the content distribution network?

32
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,190
And how do we protect
browser extensions from page?
