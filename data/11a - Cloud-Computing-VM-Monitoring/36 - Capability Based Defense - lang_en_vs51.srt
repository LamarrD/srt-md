Now let's discuss some novel idea
to defend against denial of service

2
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:05,650
attacks.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,690
There are a number of examples for
capability-based defenses.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,260
You're welcome to study these papers.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,000
Here's a brief overview
of these defenses.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,260
The basic idea is that the receivers,
such as a server,

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,760
can specify what packets they want,
and this is called the capability.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,330
When the sender sends a request to
the receiver, he must include capability

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,450
in his SYN packet, meaning that
he needs to tell the server that,

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,484
hey, I am the packet that you want.

11
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:37,290
When a client wants to
connect to a server,

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,970
it needs to first request capability.

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,447
And such a request
should be very limited.

14
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:46,509
And the server can respond with
a capability that the sender can later

15
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:48,785
include in his packets.

16
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:53,800
Furthermore, all the routers will only
forward packets with valid capability.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,361
If a source is attacking,
then its capability can be revoked, and

18
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:02,360
as a result, the routers will drop or
block such packets.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,820
And this can take place as close
to the source as possible.
