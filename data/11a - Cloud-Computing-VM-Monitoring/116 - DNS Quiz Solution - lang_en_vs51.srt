1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,590
The first statement,
DNS stores IP address.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,190
For security reasons, the domain
name is stored somewhere else.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,540
This is false.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,250
DNS stores both the IP address and
the domain name.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,140
That's the whole point of providing
the mapping between domain name and

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,280
IP address.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,380
The second statement.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,640
All domain names and IP addresses
are stored at the Central Registry.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,650
This is true.

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,790
When a new domain name is
registered at a local DNS,

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,030
it will also be copied
to the Central Registry.

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,640
The third statement,
it can take several days for

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,890
information to propagate
to all DNS servers.

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,990
This is true.

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,820
It takes anywhere from 12 to 36 hours to

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,030
propagate information to
all DNS servers worldwide.
