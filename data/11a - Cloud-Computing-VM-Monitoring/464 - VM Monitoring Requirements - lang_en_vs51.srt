1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,450
But there are also
security requirements.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,980
The code and

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,380
data of the security tool need to be
isolated from the untrusted machine.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,360
The handling of the security
events has to be secure.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,130
Furthermore, the security tool should
not rely on untrusted code and data.
