Address Resolution Protocol or ARP is
a protocol designed to map IP network

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,640
addresses to the hardware addresses
used by the data link protocol.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,500
Open Shortest Path First or
OSPF is a protocol

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,120
that uses a link state routing
algorithm for interior routing.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,590
Border Gateway Protocol or
BGP is a protocol designed to exchange

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,960
routing and reachability information
among autonomous systems or AS.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,610
Here's an example of how op works.

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,830
Supposed a router received data
with a destination IP address

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,720
of a host within each
local area network.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,800
It needs to know the MAC address or

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,920
the destination IP address in order
to send the data to the host.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,720
This is because machines on the same
local area network identify each other

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,450
via MAC addresses.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,470
Here, the router sends
an OP request asking for

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,080
the MAC address of
the specified IP address.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,340
This request will reach all
computers on a network because

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,560
the destination MAC address is one
there's accepted by all computers.

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,320
The ARP reply essentially says, hey,
I'm the host with the IP address and

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,250
here's my MAC address.

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,800
On OSPF looks for
the lowest cost path within nodes.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,290
In this instance, let's assume that
all the lengths are of the same cost.

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,470
What would be the shortest path
between the node R3 and R5?

23
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:34,550
Obviously, the shortest path is to
go from R3 to R4 and then, to R5.

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,810
In BPG, the autonomous systems exchange
information through peer exchanges.

25
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,180
In this example, each AS talks to a peer

26
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,510
to learn the address prefix of
the computers within their peer network.

27
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,110
This helps the ASs to work
together to determine

28
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,630
how to route traffic from
one network to the other.
