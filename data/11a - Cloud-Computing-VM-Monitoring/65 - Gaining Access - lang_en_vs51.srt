00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,390
Once you have obtained the relevant
information of network services and

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,630
user accounts, now you can exploit and
gain access to the network.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,960
Typically, there are all
the existing tools and

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,040
scripts associated with
known vulnerabilities.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,600
But of course, you can customize
them to suit your needs.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,240
On the other hand, if the vulnerability
is new or there does not exist a tool or

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,590
script, then you have to
develop the exploit yourself.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,790
In general, this is a manual process and
can be quite difficult.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,790
Here are some examples of techniques and
tools for gaining access.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,060
For example, you can use tools
to capture and crack password.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,680
And there are tools that will exploit
vulnerabilities in widely used services.
