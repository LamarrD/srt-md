1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,390
You may wonder, don't we already
have defenses against malware?

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,350
Yes we do, but
malware keeps evolving very fast and

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,460
some of the traditional
mechanisms are not adequate.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,910
We should deploy defense in depth,
and for network protection we have

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,090
firewalls as the prevention mechanism
and IDS as the detection mechanism.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,720
But for firewall,
command control traffic

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,980
can look just like normal traffic,
such as visiting a webpage.

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,960
For IDS that analyzes the payload
of traffic, the encrypted or

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,990
specially encoded malicious
contents can evade such analysis.

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,760
On the host, if you ask the user's
consent, most often since the users

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,940
often do not understand the security
implications, they will simply say yes.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,260
In terms of antivirus software,
the traditional signature matching

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,630
approaches are not effective where
malware uses obfuscation techniques.

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,220
And so, we have to continue to develop

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,360
more complex behavior-based
analysis approaches.
