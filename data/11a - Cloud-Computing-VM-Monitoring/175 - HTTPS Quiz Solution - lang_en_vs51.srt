1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,890
The first four can be
encrypted by HTTPS.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,740
Host address and port numbers
are used to route traffic and

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,360
so they're not encrypted.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,110
The amount of transferred data and

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,910
length of session can be inferred
by observing the traffic.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,530
So the attacker can learn this.
