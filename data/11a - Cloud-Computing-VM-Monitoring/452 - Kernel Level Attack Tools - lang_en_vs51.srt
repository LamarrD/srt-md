00:00:00,298 --> 00:00:03,980
Lets's first review what happens when we
placed a security tool in the opening

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,061
system kernel, which has high
privilege and user level applications.

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:10,720
A kernel-level security tool
has a high privilege, and

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,960
therefore, it can detect and remove
a malware process at a user level.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,800
But since the security tool has a same
privilege as the attacker in the kernel,

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,940
such as a rootkit, it can be compromise.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,920
In other words,
the security tool cannot be isolated or

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,900
protected from a kernel-level attacker.
