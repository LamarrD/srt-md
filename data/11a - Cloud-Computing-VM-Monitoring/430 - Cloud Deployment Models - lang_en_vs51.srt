1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,620
There are several cloud
deployment models.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,780
The first one is private cloud.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,940
Here, the cloud infrastructure is
operated solely for an organization.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,900
It may be managed by the organization or
a third party and

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,960
may exist on-premise or off-premise.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,800
Here, the cloud infrastructure is
shared by several organizations and

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,770
supports a specific community
that has shared concerns.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,950
It may be managed by the organizations
or a third party, and

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,050
may exist on-premise or off-premise.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,420
The third model is public cloud.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,400
Here, the cloud infrastructure is made
available to the general public or

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,850
a large industry group, and

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,550
is owned by an organization
selling the cloud services.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,530
The fourth one is hybrid,
is a composition of two or

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,790
more of these models.
