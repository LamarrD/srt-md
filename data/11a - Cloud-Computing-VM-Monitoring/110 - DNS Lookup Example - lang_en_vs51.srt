00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:02,410
A DNS Lookup is an iterative or

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,040
recursive process carrying
the hierarchy code database.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:13,255
For example, suppose your browser
is looking up www.cc.gatech.edu.

4
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:17,848
The local DNS service is handling
this request of looking up the IP

5
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:19,943
address of this domain name.

6
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:24,410
The query will start on the root or
top level domain servers.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,438
That is,
the local DNS server asks the root and

8
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:34,958
top level domain servers what is
the IP address of www.cc.gatech.edu.

9
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:40,190
And these servers say, I don't know, but
I know the main server of gatech.edu.

10
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,490
So the local DNS server then
asks gatech.edu DNS server

11
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,236
what is the IP address
of www.cc.gatech.edu.

12
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:54,082
And the gatech.edu DNS server says,
I don't know but

13
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:57,016
I know the name server cc.gatech.edu.

14
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:01,913
So finally,
the name server cc.gatech.edu says,

15
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:07,344
I know the IP address of
www.cc.gatech.edu and here it is.

16
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:12,219
So that's an example of looking up
a domain name in most iterative or

17
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:14,794
recursive queries to DNS servers.

18
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:19,410
There are several types of DNS
records in the response to DNS query.

19
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,250
One is the NS record.

20
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,310
This points to a name server.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:23,946
That is,

22
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:28,883
this record contains the IP address
of a name server such as gatech.edu.

23
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:31,130
And then there's A record.

24
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,475
This contains the address of
the domain name in the original query.

25
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:40,465
For example, www.cc.gatech.edu.

26
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,767
And then there's MX record.

27
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:46,830
This contains the address of
the mail server for the domain.

28
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,725
For example, mail.gatech.edu.

29
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:52,415
And finally, there's a TXT record.

30
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:55,990
It contains all the useful
information about a domain.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,310
For example, it can be used
to distribute public keys.
