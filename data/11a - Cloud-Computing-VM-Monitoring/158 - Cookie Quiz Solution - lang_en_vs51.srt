00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,930
In particular, a cookie that can
only be sent in requests originating

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,620
from the same origin as the target
domain is a SameSite cookie.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,960
Again, this can be used to defend
against cross-site request forgery.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,230
And a cookie that cannot be accessed by
client-side APIs is the HTTPOnly cookie.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,660
It can be used to defend against
cross-site scripting attacks.
