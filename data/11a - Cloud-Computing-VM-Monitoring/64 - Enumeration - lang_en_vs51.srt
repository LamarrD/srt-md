00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,490
You can also perform
more targeted attack or

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,220
testing by figuring out which user
accounts are poorly protected.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,220
And obviously, this is more targeted and
intrusive than scanning.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,570
And here are the techniques and
tools for enumeration.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,310
For example, you can use these
tools to list user accounts and

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,360
use these other tools to find
out file sharing information.
