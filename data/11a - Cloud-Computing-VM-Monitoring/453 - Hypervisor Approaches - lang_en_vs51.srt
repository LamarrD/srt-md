1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,460
With virtualization,

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,710
we can put the security tool
in a separate virtual machine.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,109
For example, we call this the security
virtual machine dedicated for

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,540
security analysis.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,480
Now the security tool is
isolated from the virtual machine

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,790
that has the malware.

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,080
But then the question is,
how can a security tool detect or

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,830
stop a malware in
a different virtual machine?

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,740
As we will discuss next, the security
tool, with the help of the hypervisor,

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,160
can perform introspection of
the other virtual machine.
