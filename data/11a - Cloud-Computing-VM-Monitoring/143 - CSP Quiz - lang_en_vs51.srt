1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,480
Now let's do a quiz on CSP.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,310
Which of the following
statements are true?

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,520
First, if you have third party forum
software that has inline script,

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,620
CSP cannot be used.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,610
Second, CSP will allow
third party widgets,

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,670
such as Google +1 button,
to be embedded on your site.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:27,170
Third, for a really secure site,
start with allowing everything,

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,750
then restrict once you know which
sources will be used on your site.
