1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,430
There are three cloud service models.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,950
The first one is Software as a Service.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,380
It enables a customer to use
a provider's applications

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,130
running on a cloud infrastructure.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,260
This applications on a cloud
can be accessful from various

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,360
kind devices through a thin client
interface such as the web browser.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,230
The second model is
Platform as a Service.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,910
It enables a consumer to deploy
on to the cloud infrastructure

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,190
consumer created applications
using programming languages and

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,590
tools supported by the cloud provider.

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,479
The third model is
Infrastructure as a Service.

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,690
It enables a consumer to provision
processing storage networks and

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,760
other fundamental computing resources on
the cloud where the consumer is able to

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,320
deploy and run arbitrary software,
which can include operating systems and

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,070
applications.
