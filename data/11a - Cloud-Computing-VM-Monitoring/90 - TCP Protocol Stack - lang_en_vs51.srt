00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,770
Now let's take a look at
TCP IP network stack.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,610
The Link Layer is a group of protocols

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,900
that only operate on the length
the host is physically connected to.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,900
The network or internet layer is a group
of protocols that are used to transport

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,390
packets from one host to another and may
cross network boundaries if necessary.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,250
The Transport layer protocols provide,
host to host communication services for

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,290
applications.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,860
They provide services such as connection
oriented data stream support,

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,310
reliability, flow control and
multi tasking.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,720
The Application layer protocols
depend upon the underlying

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,320
Transport layer protocol to establish
host to host data transfer channels.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,817
And manage the data exchange
in a client-server or

13
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:49,140
peer-to-peer networking model.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,830
When host A sends
traffic data to host B,

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,070
the data usually starts
as Application message.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,440
The Transport layer segments the data
and puts TCP header onto the segments.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,810
The IP layer then puts the IP
header on these segments, and

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,540
they become the IP packet.

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,320
The Link Layer puts a link header onto
the IP packets, and this becomes frames.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,110
And this Link Layer frame can
then be sent to the link,

21
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,720
connected to the host,
such as the ethernet cable.
