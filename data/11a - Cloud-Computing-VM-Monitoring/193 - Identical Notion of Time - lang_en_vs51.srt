1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,880
The most challenging
transparency requirement

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,110
is the identical notion of time.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,680
In particular, if malware uses
network timing measurements

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,030
to infer the presence of analyzer.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,650
For example,
the analyzer causes delay, or

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,410
the website that the malware
connects to is not a real one.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,260
There are many direct or

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,140
indirect measurements that
a malware can perform and

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,250
it is impossible to identify all direct
or indirect measurement techniques.

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,360
In fact, the problem of identifying all
network-based timing measurements is

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,400
equivalent to the problem of detecting
and removing all covert channels.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,120
This problem has been
proved to be undecidable.
