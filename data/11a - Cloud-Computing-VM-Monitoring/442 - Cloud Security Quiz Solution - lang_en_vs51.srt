1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,928
The first statement, most data in
transit is encrypted, this is true.

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:08,280
Close to 90% of the service
providers encrypt data in transit.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,440
The second statement, most data at
rest is encrypted, this is false.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,420
Only 10% of the providers
encrypt data at rest.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,960
The third statement, all data at rest
should be encrypted, this is false.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,020
In reality there's plenty of data that
does not require security protection,

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,160
and therefore such data does not
need to be encrypted at rest
