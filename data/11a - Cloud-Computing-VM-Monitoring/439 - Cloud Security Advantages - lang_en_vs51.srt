1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,469
Let's summarize the security advantages
a cloud computing environment

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,570
can provide.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,310
These include Data Fragmentation and
Dispersal, Dedicated Security Team,

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,060
Greater Investment in Security
Infrastructure, Fault Tolerance and

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,620
Reliability, Greater Resiliency,

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,630
Hypervisor Protection
Against Network Attacks and

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,610
the Possible Reduction
of C&amp;A Activities.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,310
Furthermore, the compliance
analysis is simplified and

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,870
data can be held by unbiased party.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,050
There is Low-Cost associated with
Disaster Recovery and Data Storage.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,240
There are on demand
security controls and

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,400
real time detection of system tampering.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,550
Reconstitution of services is easy and
vast.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,790
And an advanced Honeynet
can be deployed.
