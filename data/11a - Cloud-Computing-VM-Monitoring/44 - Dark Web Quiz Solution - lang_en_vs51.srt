A deep web is one that's not indexed

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,990
by the standard search
engines such as Google.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,928
A dark web refers to also invisible
web or hidden web where the web

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:15,338
content typically only exists
on so-called darknets.

5
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:17,420
And so what is a darknet?

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,885
It is an overlayed network that can
only be assessed with specific software,

7
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,440
configurations or

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,960
authorization, often using non-standard
communication protocols and ports.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,430
Two example darknet are the friend
to friend peer to peer networks and

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,290
the privacy network such as tor,
T-O-R, tor.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,490
And a surface web is one that we
are probably most familiar with.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,040
It contains web contents that
are public, searchable and

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,360
indexed by standard search engines.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,270
When we think of the Internet we're
usually referring to the surface web.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,420
As you can see in this visual,

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,770
the surface web is actually a very
small part of the Internet.
