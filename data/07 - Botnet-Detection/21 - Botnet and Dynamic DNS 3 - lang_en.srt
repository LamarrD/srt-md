1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,220
Now let's discuss how we detect
botnets in large networks such an ISP.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,710
Here, we can focus on the DNS queries

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,010
that can be observed by the recursive
DNS server and the ISP.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,490
That is, we can analyze the Internet
traffic from the internal host to

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,490
the DNS server.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,239
In particular,

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,090
we can detect any abnormal growth
of the popularity of a domain name.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,440
It can suggest that this domain name
is used for botnet command-control.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,300
Intuitively, the reason
that a botnet will grow

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,630
is that more machines become infected,
and become bots.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,340
Therefore, the growth pattern of
a botnet corresponds to the propagation

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,010
pattern of an infection.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,655
According to studies, exploit-based
infection grows exponentially.

14
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:42,620
Email-based infection grows
exponentially or linearly.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,870
And dry-by downloads
growth likely sublinear.

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,500
In a large ISP, there are many domain
names being looked up every day.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,560
But we don't have to
analyze all domain names.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,110
In fact, we can focus on
a few anomalous domain names.

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,340
These are domain names
that look suspicious.

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,310
In particular, many regularly spelled,
easily sounding domain names

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,300
have been taken up by businesses and
individuals already.

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,580
Therefore botnets are forced to use
very random looking domain names.

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,890
In other words, these random looking
domain names are suspicious.

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,330
And then we need to
analyze the growth pattern

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,160
of these suspicious domain names.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,420
In particular, we look for
the exponential or

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,890
linear growth of their popularities.

28
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,740
Here's a sketch of our ideas.

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,370
We assume a baseline of N days,
and we assume that,

30
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,120
within this N days,
all domains are legitimate.

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,110
Therefore, we record these
domains In a Bloom filter.

32
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,310
A Bloom filter is a very
efficient representation of set.

33
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,820
That is, we use the Bloom filter
to record a set of domains

34
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,450
observed within these N days.

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,870
We also use a Markov model to model
how these domain names are spelled.

36
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,410
After this baseline, whenever we
observe a new domain, that is,

37
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,540
a domain that is not in our Bloom
filter on a set of recorded domains.

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,610
And if this domain does
not fit our Markov model,

39
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,120
that means it is spelled in
a different way and looks suspicious.

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,610
Then we know that we have a new and
suspicious domain.

41
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,740
Then we analyze the lookup sequence
to this new and suspicious domain.

42
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,770
And if the growth is linear or

43
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,660
exponential, then we know that
this domain is used for botnets.

44
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,020
So far we have discussed
botnet detection.

45
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,950
The latest threats are more targeted and
more advanced.

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,920
For example, the use custom built
malware on zero-day exploits,

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,240
their activities are low-and-slow and
they move within network and

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,510
covering their tracks.

49
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,500
Even the existing botnet detection
systems are not effective

50
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,120
against these targeted advanced threats.

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,250
In order to counteract
these targeted and

52
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,880
advanced threats, we need
multifaceted monitoring and analysis.

53
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,620
That is we need malware analysis,
host-based monitoring, forensics, and

54
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,560
recovery, network monitoring,
Internet monitoring, threat analysis,

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,180
and attribution.
