1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,570
Now let's focus on how do we detect
that a domain is used for upon as C&C.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,340
There are a number of heuristics
based on observations.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,350
First, member masses purchase a domain,
they must use credit card, and

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,000
that leaves traceable
financial information.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,830
And the other limit such traceable
information as little as possible.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,910
Therefore, they may do the so-called
package deal, where for

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,240
one second level domain,
they're going to use it for

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,220
multiple three level domains for
botnets, for example here for

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,730
the same package deal for
the second level domain evilhacker.org,

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,240
there are multiple botnets using
different three level domains,

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,455
the point is that with a single
financial transaction,

12
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:39,920
they can support multiple botnets,
therefore

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,620
we can cluster the three level domains
under the same second level domain

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,070
that's looks similar in their names or
they resolved to similar subnets of IPs.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,811
Because they're likely to
be botnets they're related.

16
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:54,400
And we sum up the look-ups to all
of these domains within a cluster.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,535
By doing so we will compare the look-up
patterns of legitimate domains.

18
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:00,870
which is the Botnet domains
they look different.

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,019
That is the Botnet domains tend
to have larger lookup volumes.

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,780
And remember these domains
are in dynamic DNS providers and

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,900
the domains tend to be small and
medium sized businesses,

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,570
therefore legitimate domains will not
have a very large lookup volumes.

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,580
Another observation is that bots tend
to look up their their Command and

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,720
Control service as soon as their host
machines are connected to the internet.

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,120
The intrusion is that bots must
maintain communication with

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,760
the command control server and since
they have no control over when the host

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,050
machines connect to the internet,
they must take their first opportunity.

28
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,040
The result is that there
is an exponential arrival

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,790
of DNS request from the bots,

30
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,190
whereas legitimate DNS lookups by normal
user activities is a lot smoother.

31
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,220
For example, Human uses don't all
immediately check the same side.

32
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,380
Therefore, if you sought the lookout
volume per hour by 24 hour windows,

33
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,960
we can see the exponential arrival
rate of the bot's queries,

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,400
whereas human queries
are a lot smoother.

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,060
There are other detection heuristics.

36
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,208
For example, the look up's
are from all over the internet.

37
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:04,620
And a C&C server is resolved to many
different IP's across the internet.

38
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,169
And the resolved IP address
change frequently and so on.

39
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,460
Any of these observations alone
cannot effectively detect

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,010
a Botnet command control domain.

41
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,900
And therefore,
we combine them in a detection system.
