00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,814
With regards to malware,

2
00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:04,530
the laws of engagements are changing.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,310
In the past, the enemy was easy to distinguish,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,500
we just needed to look.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
The rise of sophisticated malware,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,490
such as botnets and APTs have changed this dynamic.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,935
We're now in the age where distinguishing friend from foe is more difficult.

8
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:27,705
In this lesson, we're going to examine methods to detect botnets.

9
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:32,460
We will discuss the subtle signs of botnet activities in our networks,

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,335
which will lead to, hopefully,

11
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:37,340
ways to mitigate the damage of botnets.
