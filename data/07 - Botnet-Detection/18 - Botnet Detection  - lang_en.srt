00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,870
So far, we have discussed botnet
detection in the Enterprise network.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,170
Now, let's discuss how we
detect botnets on the internet.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,520
We observed that a botnet must
use internet protocols and

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,770
services in order to maintain
a network infrastructure.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,760
For example,

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,120
in order to maintain its network
structure must use some sort of look-up

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,760
services to find command-and-control
servers or the peers.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,120
And you know that to support is
various kinds of malicious activities,

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,180
a botnet must use hosting services,
for example to store and

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,060
distribute attack data and
for malware download.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,460
A botnet can also use transport services
to route or hide its attack traffic.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,380
Therefore by identifying the abnormal
use of internet services,

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,190
we can detect botnet
activities on the internet.

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,540
In this lesson, let's focus on DNS.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,990
And the reason is that most bots use
DNS to locate command control and

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,820
hosting service.
