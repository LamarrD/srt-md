00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,025
Let's analyze why the traditional
security measures cannot detect Botnets

2
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:04,772
effectively.

3
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:05,493
First of all,

4
00:00:05,493 --> 00:00:09,222
traditional signature-based
anti-virus systems are not effective,

5
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:13,150
because bot codes are typically packed
and they can use rootkit to hide.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,934
And they also use frequent updates
to defeat anti-virus tools.

7
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:20,829
The traditional IDS/IPS are not
effective, because they typically look

8
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:24,955
at the specific aspect of an attack For
example, let's be specific exploit.

9
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:28,560
Whereas Botnet typically perform
multiple kinds of activities,

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,627
because they are for long-term use.

11
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:34,897
That is, although we can detect that a
host has been compromised by an exploit,

12
00:00:34,897 --> 00:00:37,280
we do not know that
it belongs to Botnet.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,416
Because we need to analyze its
command control traffic and

14
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,090
daily malicious activities.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,710
Honeypots and
Honeynets are also not effective.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,516
First of all,
since they only passively waiting for

17
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:51,493
incoming connections they are to be
lucky to capture botnet activities.

18
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:56,063
In addition, sophisticated bot malware
can detect a honeypot because the lack

19
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:57,914
of realistic user activities.

20
00:00:57,914 --> 00:01:01,830
And since a Honeypot is a single host
it cannot detect a network of bots.
