1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,250
For example, after the user logs out,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,550
he should be allowed to log
in with a different account.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,640
And a website should prevent
a user from accessing content

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,230
left behind by a previous user.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,280
So what should happen during a log out?

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,060
First, the session token on
a browser should be deleted.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,980
Second, on a server side, the session
token should be marked as expired.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,281
The problem is that many web sites do 1,
but

9
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:31,190
not 2, this is especially dangerous for
sites that use HTTPS for

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,844
login, but then fall back to
the clear text HTTP after login.

11
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:40,499
This is because an active network
attacker can intercept the clear

12
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,416
text HTTP traffic and
steal a copy of the session token.

13
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:48,122
Then even after the user logs out,
because the server does not

14
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:52,981
expire the session token, the attacker
can continue to use that session token.
