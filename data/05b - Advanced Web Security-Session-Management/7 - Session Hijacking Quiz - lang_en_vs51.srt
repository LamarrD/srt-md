1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,940
Now let's do a quiz
on session hijacking.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,270
Check all the statements that are true.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,770
First, active session hijacking
involves disconnecting the user

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,800
from the server once
that user is logged on.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,060
Social engineering is required to
perform this type of hijacking.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,550
Second, in passive session hijacking,

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,520
the attacker silently captures
the credentials of a user.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,070
Social engineering is required to
perform this type of hijacking.
