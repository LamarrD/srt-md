00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,200
To summarize what we've learned about
the security of session management,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,380
we should always assume cookie data
retrieved from client is adversarial,

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,710
or not trusted.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,231
There are multiple ways
to store session tokens.

5
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,421
Cookies, by themselves, are not secure.

6
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,880
For example, they can be overwritten.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,440
Session tokens should be unpredictable.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,910
And finally, when a user logs out,

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,480
the server should invalidate
the session token.
