00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,760
Here's how we should educate users to
counter social engineering attacks.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,480
Never disclose passwords to anybody.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,280
Only the IT staff should discussed
details of the network and

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,840
system configurations and IT staff
should not answers survey calls.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,660
This also check with the call
from the vendor is legitimate.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,060
Also, we should limit information
in all auto-reply emails.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,030
Keep information in all auto-reply
emails to a bare minimum.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,440
We should always escort our guests.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,960
This protects against attacks such as
attackers dressing up like repairmen or

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,860
trusted authority figure.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,670
We should always question
people that we don't know.

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,830
We should educate all employees about
security, both physical and IT security.

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,640
We should have a central reporting and
management of all suspicious behavior.
