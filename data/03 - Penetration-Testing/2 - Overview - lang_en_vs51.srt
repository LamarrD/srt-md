00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,760
Let's have an overview of what
penetration testing is all about.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,410
Penetration testing is used to
evaluate the security of a network.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,720
More specifically,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,210
penetration testing is used to
evaluate all security controls.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,209
These include the security procedures,
the operations, and the technologies.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,870
With penetration testing, you can find
out how secure your network really is.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,550
In particular, you can discover
security vulnerabilities.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,240
And by actually exploiting
the vulnerabilities,

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,210
you can also demonstrate how likely
the threats can take place and

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,120
what are the likely damages
associated with these threats.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,270
The scope of penetration testing
include not just technical or

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,420
cyber operations, it can also
include social engineering, and

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,080
also gaining physical access
to your organization.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,580
The scale of the testing
includes the entire network.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,070
For example, the testing may include
your mobile devices, or BYOD.
