00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,550
In this lesson, we will discuss
the first line of network defense.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,510
The basic tools and

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,850
techniques of penetration testing and
security assessments.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,060
We will also discuss one
of the most powerful tools

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,410
of the network hacker, you.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,440
Yes, you and I.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,260
In fact, everyone has a potential
to be a hacker's best friend.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,450
Social engineering is a fast,
low risk method to gain access to data.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,330
Pay close attention to
the methods used and

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,010
think about how they can be deployed
to make a network more secure.
