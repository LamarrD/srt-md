1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,710
Now let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,939
In 2011, the security company,
RSA, was compromised.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,410
And it began with social engineering.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,640
Once gaining access,

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,230
the attackers then installed backdoor
using Adobe Flash vulnerability.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,380
In this quiz,

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,030
list the steps the attackers used to
access RSAs Adobe Flash software.
