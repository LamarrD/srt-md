1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,180
Now let's discuss the methodology
of penetration testing.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,410
Penetration testing
includes several steps.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,380
The first step is footprinting.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,310
This is about finding the general
information of your network.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,800
Next step is scanning.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,200
This is about finding more detailed
information about your network,

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,480
such as the services
available on your network.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,600
The third step is enumeration.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,520
It finds more target information
such as user account.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,130
The fourth step is gaining access.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,200
It finds vulnerabilities associated
with the network services, and

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,570
then exploit these vulnerabilities
to gain access to the network.

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,270
The fifth step is escalating privilege.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,060
The goal here is to gain
route of super user access.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,570
The sixth step is pilfering.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,550
The goal here is to try to steal
information from the network.

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,280
This is one of the standard activities
that an attacker would do to a network.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,970
The seventh step is covering the tracks.

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,400
The goal here is to hide
an evidence of a break in so

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,560
that security amends cannot easily find
out that the network has been breached.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,080
The last step here is
creating back doors.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,470
The goal is to create easy access for

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,120
future malicious
activities on the network.

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,360
The last few steps can be iterated for

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,760
example to move from one part
of the network to another part.
