00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,340
Let's discuss the impersonation
techniques first.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,710
For example, an attacker can
pretend to be an employee and

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,490
call the help desk, and claim that
he has forgotten his password.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,050
A common weakness is that,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,180
the help desk does not require
adequate authentication.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,280
For example, the help desk may just
ask for the mother's maiden name.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,170
And the attacker may only know this,

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,390
because he has read the Facebook
information of the employee.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,410
Another impersonation technique is
to fake a third party authorization.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,890
For example, the attacker
can claim that a third party

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,706
has authorized him to
access the network.

12
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:40,700
And if the attacker can provide
the fishing information

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,090
to convince people that he
really knows the third party.

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,530
Then, he will have easy time gaining
the trust and the access to the network.

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,598
In particular,
if the third party is not present.

16
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:55,880
Another very effective
impersonation technique is to

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,070
pretend to be a tech support person.

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,640
For example, the attacker can claim that

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,160
the company needs to reconfigure its
systems, and ask for user credentials.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,695
If the users have not been properly
trained to guard their credentials,

21
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,087
then this attack can easily succeed.

22
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:16,163
Another old fashioned way of
impersonation is to just walk around and

23
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:18,870
see what information is valuable.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,120
For example, passwords or sticky notes,
or other kind of important documents,

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,250
or even overhearing
important conversations.

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,870
An attacker can dress
up like a repairman,

27
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,790
because a repairman is typically
allowed access to the facility.

28
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,970
The attacker can then plant listening
devices to capture useful information.

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,180
This exploit works
because users typically

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,440
do not question people in uniform.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,140
Similarly, an attacker can
pretend to be someone in charge

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,210
of a department or company.

33
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,840
For example, the attacker can pretend to
be a medial personnel, a home inspector,

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,550
or school superintendent.

35
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,190
In each of these examples,

36
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,910
the attacker can actually gain
useful information from a user.

37
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,440
The attacker can gain information such
as address, mother's maiden name, and so

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,169
on of an employee.

39
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,050
And this information can then
be used to impersonate employee

40
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,200
through the call to a help desk.

41
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,080
Again, this exploit works because
users tend to trust authority.

42
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,390
Impersonation can also
take place in snail mail.

43
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,520
For example, an attacker can send mail
to a user pretending to be an authority

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,780
and ask for personal information.

45
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,420
This exploit works because users

46
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,580
tend to trust the printed materials
more than webpages and emails.

47
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,060
These are examples that I'm
sure you're familiar with.
