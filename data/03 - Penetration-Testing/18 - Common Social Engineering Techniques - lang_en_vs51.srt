00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,650
Now let's discuss the common
social engineering techniques.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,420
The first category is impersonation.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,816
For example,
you can impersonate help desks,

4
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:12,540
third-party authorization,
technical support.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,950
Or you can roam the halls or tailgate or
you can impersonate a trusted authority.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,110
And you can even send snail mail.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,420
The other category of social engineering
techniques involve the use of computers.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,490
This include pop-up windows,
instant messages and IRC,

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,600
email attachments, email scams,
chain letters, efficient websites.
