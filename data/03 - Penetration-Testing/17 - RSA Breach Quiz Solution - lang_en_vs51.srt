1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,090
The first step is to identify
employees that are vulnerable.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,560
The second step was crafting an email
with an enticing subject line.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,760
In particular, the subject line was
a provocative 2011 recruitment plan.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,040
And one employee was
intrigued enough to open it.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,670
The first step is to hide
an executable file in the e-mail, so

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,400
that it will install on the victim's
computer when the e-mail is opened.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,800
In this case, the attachment is an Excel
spreadsheet, that contains a zero day

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,689
exploit that leads to a back
door through Adobe Flash.

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:37,070
This one e-mail resulted in
a loss of $66 million for RSA.
