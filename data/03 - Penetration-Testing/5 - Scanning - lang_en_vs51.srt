1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,750
Once you have the general information
such as the IP ranges of a network,

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,100
now you gain more detailed information
of the network using scanning.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,070
You can find out which machine is up,
and which ports are open.

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,950
Similarly on the servers
what services are running.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,680
You can even find out the versions and
configurations of these services.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,720
Then you can look up the corresponding
vulnerability information on the web.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,330
For example for a particular
version of the Apache web server,

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,320
you can look it up on the web to see
one of the known vulnerabilities,

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,940
such as what input can
cause a buffer overflow.

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,220
Most promising avenues
are typically associated with

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,030
services that are always up,
such as the web services, so

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,220
you want to focus on
analyzing these services.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,750
On the other hand,
you want to avoid detection so

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,890
you want to reduce the frequency and
volume of your scanning and analysis.

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,900
Here are the different techniques and
tools for scanning.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,690
As you can see, Nmap is one of the most
popular tools It can find out which

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,460
IP's up, which port is open and
even perform OS finger prints.
