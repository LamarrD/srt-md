1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,505
The next step is escalating privilege.

2
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:05,166
And the goal is to gain
super user access so

3
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:09,060
that you can gain complete
control of the system.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,830
Here's some examples and tools.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,240
Again, you can capture and
crack the super user passwords.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,800
There are tools that will
exploit vulnerabilities

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,360
of privileged services in order
to help you gain good access.
