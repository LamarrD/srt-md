00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,270
As we discussed earlier, penetration
testing can include social engineering.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,270
So now let's discuss social engineering.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,750
We all know that users
are the weakest link in security,

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,973
so the goal here is to use social
engineering techniques to evaluate

5
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:19,027
how vulnerable your user
population really is.

6
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:19,875
In particular,

7
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:24,130
you will want to find out which user
groups are particularly vulnerable.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,850
You will likely discover policy gaps, so
you will want to fix these policies and

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,220
develop new mechanisms including
educating and training the users.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,120
Social engineering is effective
when the users are manipulated

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,370
into undermining the security
of their own systems.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,040
This can be accomplished by abusing
the trust relationships among the users.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,400
Social engineering can be very easy and
cheap for the attacker

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,700
because the attacker does not need any
specialized tools or technical skills.
