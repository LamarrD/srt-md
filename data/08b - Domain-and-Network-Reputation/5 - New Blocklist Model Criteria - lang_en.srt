1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,695
Now, let's discuss a new blocklist model.

2
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:05,970
We know that static blocklist are increasingly ineffective.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,345
What we need is a dynamic reputation system that

4
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:13,970
outputs the reputation score or the trustworthiness of a domain.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,290
The intuition of this new model is

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,120
that legitimate use of domains and sites are different for malicious use.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,725
The question is, how do we observe such differences?

8
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:29,485
Our intuition is that such differences can be observed in DNS traffic.

9
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:35,160
For example, we can look at the patterns of requests and the reputation of the requester,

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,660
the resolved IPs, and the network providers for these domains.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,999
Therefore, our approach is to analyze DNS traffic,

12
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:48,110
extract temporal and statistical features and then apply machine learning

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,960
algorithms to learn models that can provide the dynamic score of a domain.
