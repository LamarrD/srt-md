00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,765
Traditionally, when an IP address is discovered to have been used to send spam,

2
00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:07,950
it is added to a blacklist.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,395
This is called a static blacklist.

4
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:12,920
If an IP address is in a blacklist,

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,770
then emails coming from this IP address can be blocked.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,145
This is a great idea except that attackers also know about the blacklist.

7
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:27,050
So spammers can circumvent the blacklist by using new IP addresses,

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,765
and by the time an IP address is discovered

9
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:33,005
to have been used to send spam and edit to blacklist,

10
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:36,550
the spammers can then move on to use a new IP address.

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,150
We need to change this model to be in line with our philosophy about network security,

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,330
and that is an IP address should not be trusted by default.
