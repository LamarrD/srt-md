1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,670
In our study, we first identified the mobile devices,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,825
and then we attribute each DNS query to a device.

3
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:13,115
We then analyze the repetition of the resource records associated with the DNS query.

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:15,615
We use the Notos features to analyze

5
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:20,130
the hosting infrastructures of mobile domains and compute repetition scores.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,155
The difference is that we use different features.

7
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:26,055
In particular, for mobile domain,

8
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:30,840
we first find the IP address of the machine that hosts this domain.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,915
Then for each of these IP addresses,

10
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:37,320
we extract the following features: the historic non-cellular domains,

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,635
the related historic mobile domains,

12
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:43,005
any evidence of malware association with these domains,

13
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:47,900
as well as URLs for phishing and drive-by download associated with these domains,

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,710
and evidence that these domains have been blacklisted before.

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,385
With these features and examples of malicious and legitimate mobile domains,

16
00:00:56,385 --> 00:01:00,655
Notos can then use machine learning algorithm to learn a scoring function.

17
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:05,210
This scoring function can tell us how likely a mobile domain is malicious.

18
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,735
Here are some results from our study.

19
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:13,090
This column is the breakdown of total number of DNS requests for mobile devices.

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,135
As you can see, there are lot more Android devices than iOS devices.

21
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:21,280
When a machine on Internet has filed a petition,

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,055
we call it as machine tainted.

23
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:26,525
Some mobile domains are hosted on these tainted machines.

24
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:30,655
This column shows the percentage of requests to this tainted hosts.

25
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:33,860
As we can see, the iOS and Android devices

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,505
are equally likely to connect to these tainted hosts.

27
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:40,340
We also measure the number of devices,

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,000
their lookup domains that are associated with known malware families.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,980
As you can see, the number of devices we've known,

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,600
malware infection is small.
