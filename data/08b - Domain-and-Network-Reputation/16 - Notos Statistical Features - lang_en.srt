00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,850
Here's a summary of Notos statistical and temporal features.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,425
The network-based features are extracted from the set of related historic IPs.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:13,860
The features include, the total number of IPs historically associated with a domain,

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,050
the diversity of their geographical locations,

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,865
the number of distinct autonomous systems, and so on.

6
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:24,610
The zone-based features are extracted from the set of related historic domains.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,190
The features include, the average length of domain names,

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,150
the number of distinct top-level domains,

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,135
the occurrence frequency of different characters, and so on.

10
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:35,660
The evidence-based features include,

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,860
the number of distinct malware samples that contacted the domain,

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,670
and the same for any of its resolved IPs.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,760
Here we show the result of clustering 250,000 domains using the Noto features.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,535
As we can see, the clusters don't overlap.

15
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:53,780
This tells us that the Notos features are very good

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,930
at separating domains of different types into different clusters.
