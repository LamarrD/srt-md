00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Now, let's discuss a study of mobile malware prevalence using domain amputation.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,205
The motivation of our study is that most research

3
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:13,120
has been focusing on analyzing malicious mobile apps,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,735
but the question remains,

5
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:18,335
how prevalence are the infections on mobile devices?

6
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:22,225
Our intuition is that mobile web is actually part of

7
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:24,070
the regular web and therefore

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,460
mobile malware will use similar command control infrastructure

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,960
and therefore our approach is to analyze DNS traffic obtained

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,870
from cellular network providers and identify domains looked up by mobile apps.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,720
Then for the internet machines that host these domains,

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,890
we analyze their reputation.
