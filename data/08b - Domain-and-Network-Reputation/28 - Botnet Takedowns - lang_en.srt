1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,550
To motivate our study,

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,865
we observed that currently Botnet Takedowns are ad hoc,

3
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:08,670
and performed without oversight and sometimes are not successful.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,700
Our goal is to develop a system and framework to reason

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,245
about Takedowns and recommend the best Takedown strategies.

6
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:19,810
The goal of our study is to develop a system to reason about Takedowns,

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,960
evaluate previous takedown attempts,

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,390
and recommend future directions.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,780
The high-level idea is that we need to have

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,250
as complete knowledge of the Botnet infrastructure as possible.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,970
We use both passive DNS analysis and

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,655
malware analysis to expand our knowledge of the Botnet infrastructure.

13
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:39,460
Here's an overview of our system called RZA.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,445
We start with a set of seed domains.

15
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:44,920
These domains are known to be associated with Botnet infrastructure.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,980
They may use passive DNS data to analyze domains related to

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,500
these seed domains including the reputation

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,505
and malware samples associated with these domains.

19
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:55,890
For the malware samples,

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,595
we perform malware analysis to find out more domains,

21
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,360
and that is how our system now has

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,895
a much more complete knowledge of the Botnet infrastructure.

23
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:10,010
Based on this knowledge, we can perform analysis of previous takedowns,

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,330
and also recommend takedown strategies of a current Botnet.

25
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,530
To summarize, we start with a set of

26
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,805
seed domains they are known to be associated with Botnet infrastructure,

27
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:21,090
then we enumerate all related domains.

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,720
Some of these domains have low reputation,

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,700
and some are associated with malware.

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,985
For the malware samples,

31
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:29,645
we further interrogate to find out more domains.

32
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:32,990
Here's a high level idea of how we interrogate a malware.

33
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,090
Suppose this is domain that are malware would use by default.

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,430
So, the malware is going to perform a lookup of this domain,

35
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,165
and then connect with CNC server.

36
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:45,710
To force the malware to tell us more domains that you may use,

37
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,560
we can intercept the DNS query and respond with no such domain.

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,700
Then, if there's a backup domain,

39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,350
the malware is going to look it up.

40
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,435
Therefore, by analyzing the malware DNS traffic

41
00:01:56,435 --> 00:02:00,160
we can find out more domains that a malware might use.
