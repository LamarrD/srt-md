1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Now, let's discuss some case studies.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,515
We perform analysis of previous takedowns.

3
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:09,480
We also analyze how we can take down some of the active botnets.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,215
Here we showed a log scale of lookup volumes to different set of domains.

5
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,360
This is the date of takedown.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,630
As we can see, lookups to the seed domains,

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,895
the intogrey domains, and malware domains stop immediately at takedown or soon after.

8
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:28,215
This means that, this takedown is very effective.

9
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:29,975
In the case of Zeus,

10
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:32,730
although there are multiple groups including Microsoft and

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,540
several research groups taking place in takedowns,

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,384
their efforts were not coordinated.

13
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:42,975
More importantly, none of them had complete knowledge of the botnet infrastructure.

14
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:45,725
Therefore, even after the takedown effort,

15
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:48,980
the botnet continue to connect to its infrastructure.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,650
This takedown was accomplished by transferring the entire 3322.org name

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,380
server authority to Microsoft and

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,720
domains the malicious result to a set of long single IP addresses.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,660
That is, domains were sunk on a day of

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,905
takedown and were limited to the 3322.org domain names.

21
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:14,665
Unfortunately, this only accounted for a fraction of domains associated with malware.

22
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:19,335
Therefore, lookups to this malware associated domains remain frequent.

23
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:22,060
In other words, this is not an effective takedown.
