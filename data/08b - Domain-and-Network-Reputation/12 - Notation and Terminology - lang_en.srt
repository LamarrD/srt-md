00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Before we discuss the details of notice and coppice,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,125
let's go over some of the notations and terminologies.

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:09,210
We use RR to represent resource record.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,165
It's a tuple of domain name and its reserved IP address.

5
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:15,990
For domain, www.example.com.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,975
2LD is example.com, and 3LD is www.example.com.

7
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:25,215
The related historic IPs of a domain are

8
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:29,185
all the routable IPs historically mapped with this domain name,

9
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:30,750
and any other domain name,

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,145
within the same 2LD and 3LD.

11
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:36,130
Related historic domains of an IP address are

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,190
all the fully qualified domain names that historically had been linked with this IP,

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,975
and also, all the IPs with this address box,

14
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:45,685
and the autonomous systems.

15
00:00:45,685 --> 00:00:49,805
The authoritative domain name tuple is the requester for example,

16
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:53,230
that because of DNS, the domain name and RDATA,

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,005
which includes all information about this domain.

18
00:00:56,005 --> 00:01:01,555
Notos uses passive DNS data collected at a recursive DNS server.

19
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:04,115
For example, this can be your ISP.

20
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:09,820
In our study, we use data from multiple ISPs and data repositories.

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,660
For coppice, we use data from two large authoritative DNS servers,

22
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,420
and the Canadian top-level domain server.
