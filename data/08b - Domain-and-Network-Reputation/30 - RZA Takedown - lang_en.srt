1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,175
Now, let's discuss an ideal takedown procedure.

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:05,505
Again, we start with a set of seed domains.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,015
These domains are known to be associated with partner infrastructure.

4
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:12,075
We enumerate the infrastructure using passive DNS.

5
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:16,065
We get the malware associated with the domains and interrogate a malware.

6
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:19,630
If the malware tells us additional domains, we look back.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,440
On the other hand, if there is no addition no domains,

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,710
then we take the set of domains that we know so far and revoke all of them.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,335
That's how we take down the botnet.

10
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:32,340
If you find that the malware is using dynamically-generated domains,

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,730
then we need to first reverse engineer the algorithm,

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,180
then we need to tell the TLD operators and

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,790
DNS registrars to stop hosting or adjusting these new domains.

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,265
We will also revoke the set of non CNC domains.

15
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:50,340
If the malware exhibits behavior of using peer-to-peer network,

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,970
then we need to take down the peer-to-peer protocol.

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,050
For example, by penetrating into the peers.

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,070
We also need to revoke the set of non CNC domains.
