1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Similar to Notos, given examples of malicious and legitimate domains,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,175
Kopis can use machine learning algorithm

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,500
to learn a scoring function based on the features.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,235
Here, we show the detection performance of the scoring function.

5
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:15,830
As we can see here,

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,570
if we use more data,

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,710
meaning using a longer time window,

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,315
the accuracy is higher.

9
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:24,005
In particular, with a five-day time window,

10
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:29,050
we can achieve very high detection rate and very low false positive rate.
