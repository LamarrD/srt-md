00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,175
Now, let's discuss the temporal and statistical features of Notos.

2
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:05,720
Given a resource record,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,395
and that is a tuple of domain name and its resolve IP,

4
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:13,945
Notos uses the passive DNS data to extract network based features.

5
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:17,645
These features are based on the related historic IPs.

6
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:20,120
It also extracts the zone features.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,855
These features are based on the related historic domains.

8
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:27,720
Notos also constructs the so-called evidence features

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,480
by analyzing the blacklist and honeypot data,

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,840
and look for evidence associated with these IPs and domains.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,540
These features are then combined and forwarded to

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,610
the reputation engine which computes a reputation score for this domain.
