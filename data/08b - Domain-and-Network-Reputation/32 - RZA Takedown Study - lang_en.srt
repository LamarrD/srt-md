1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,865
Of the 45 active Botnet,

2
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:05,490
we find that too had TGA based backup mechanisms,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,120
and one had a peer-to-peer based backup mechanism.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,645
On the other hand, 42 of them are subject to DNS only Takedown.

5
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,570
To summarize the drawbacks of current Takedown efforts,

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,660
there ad hoc meaning that they don't

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,120
have complete knowledge of the Botnet infrastructure.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,600
There's a valid oversight,

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,320
meaning that different groups may step on each other,

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,395
and the success rate is not high.

11
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:28,145
Therefore, we believe that

12
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:31,725
a central authority to coordinate Takedown efforts is necessary.

13
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:35,220
Icons policies can provide an example framework.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,095
For example, there is policy for domain name dispute resolution.

15
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:41,675
There's also system for rapid suspension.

16
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:45,465
Therefore, we should study policy criteria for Takedowns,

17
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:48,244
and have the community to review such criterias.

18
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:52,200
We can test the policy with the newly created top-level domains.
