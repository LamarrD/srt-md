00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750
Here is our infrastructure to interrogate malware.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,830
You run the malware image machine and have a gateway between the malware and Internet.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,030
Therefore, we can control how the malware can connect to its infrastructure.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,475
For example, we can play with DNS, no such domain,

5
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:20,155
or TCP reset to force the malware to exhibit backup behaviors.

6
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:22,560
Such a backup behaviors can include

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,965
using additional domains or switching to a Peer-2-Peer.

8
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:29,340
We observe that a malware typically would use

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,170
hard-coded domains or when these domains are becoming not available,

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,930
it may we try again and then it may try the next set of domains and IPs as a backup.

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,605
When those are not available,

12
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:42,830
they may switch to Peer-2-Peer,

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,815
or the so-called, domain generation algorithm,

14
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:47,270
to use randomly generated domains.

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,930
The intuition behind our approach is that malware will use

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,295
an increasing number of domains and IPs when the infrastructure becomes now available.

17
00:00:56,295 --> 00:01:00,240
The easiest manipulation is by DNS and TCP.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,140
Of course, we can easily add more protocols.
