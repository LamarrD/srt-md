1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,555
A dynamic malware-related domain detection system should:

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:07,890
have global visibility into DNS request and response messages,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,544
it should not require data from other networks,

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:15,525
should be able to detect malware-related domains even if there's no repetition data.

5
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,540
Such a system should also be able to detect

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,795
malware domains before the infection which is a local network.

7
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:25,030
Therefore, the second statement is false.
