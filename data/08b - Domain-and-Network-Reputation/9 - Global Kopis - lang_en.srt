1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,650
To summarize what we have discussed so far,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,230
Notos can be deployed at Large Local Network,

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,630
such as an ISP.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,610
In other words, Notos use traffic to do recursive DNS servers

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,580
whereas Kopis is deployed at the upper level of the DNS hierarchy.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,430
In particular, the authoritative name servers or the top-level domain servers.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,260
In other words, Notos has local views and Kopis can have a global Internet view.
