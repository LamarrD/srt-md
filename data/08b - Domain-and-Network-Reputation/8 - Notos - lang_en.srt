00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,645
Now, let's discuss two DNS repetition systems.

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:05,450
The first one is NOTOS.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,735
NOTOS is a system that dynamically assigns repetition score to a domain name.

4
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:15,295
It uses features that capture the characteristics of resource provisioning,

5
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:18,555
usages, and management of DNS domains.

6
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:22,125
Given examples of legitimate and malicious domains,

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,810
NOTOS uses machine learning algorithm to

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,820
compute a scoring function based on these features.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,305
This scoring function can output a repetition score for new domain.

10
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:36,570
In our study, we are shown that NOTOS has very high accuracy.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,930
That is, it has a very low false positive rate and very high true positive rate.

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,150
That is, NOTOS can detect

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,450
a fraudulent or malicious domain weeks or days before it is widely used.

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,900
NOTOS can be applied to a large network,

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,265
for example, a particular ISP.

16
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:57,440
Whereas another system called Kopis has

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,065
Internet-wide visibility because it performs

18
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:03,595
monitoring at the upper levels of the DNS hierarchy.

19
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:10,865
That is, Kopis uses DNS traffics at authoritative DNS or top-level domain DNS service.

20
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:14,750
Similar to NOTOS, Kopis also extract a set of

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,510
statistical and temporal features from

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,825
the traffic and then uses machine learning algorithm to chain a scoring function.

23
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:27,455
Similar to NOTOS, Kopis also has very high accuracy rate.

24
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:31,025
Similar to NOTOS, Kopis can also detect

25
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:35,345
malicious domains weeks before they were listed in any blacklist.

26
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,025
Since Kopis has the Internet-wide visibility,

27
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:43,130
it can detect that a domain is being used by malware within

28
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,745
one country months or weeks before the malware begin to spread to other countries.

29
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:50,705
For example, in our study,

30
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:55,160
Kopis was able to detect a DDoS botnet rising in networks within

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,640
China almost one month before it propagated to other countries.
