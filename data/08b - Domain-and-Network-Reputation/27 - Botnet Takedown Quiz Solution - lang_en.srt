1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,665
The first statement, one of the most successful methods to taking down

2
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:09,835
a botnet requires investigators to find and target each bot in the net.

3
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:12,045
This is false because typically,

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,310
it is not possible to enumerate all paths in the net.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,350
The second statement, a proven method to stop botnets require

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,450
isolating the C&C domain from the bot net. This is true.

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,850
If you take down the command control infrastructure,

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,025
the bot net will cease to function.

9
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:30,955
The third statement, with regards to take downs,

10
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:35,670
P2P-based networks are much easier than centralized C&C networks.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,070
This is false because P2P-based networks use

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,720
distributed C&C and that's much harder to take down than centralized C&C.
