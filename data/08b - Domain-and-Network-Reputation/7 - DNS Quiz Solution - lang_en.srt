00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,075
A botnet typically have a set of domains at his disposal.

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:08,125
So, each domain is only used for short period of time.

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:11,060
A spyware is used to steal information,

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,870
and it needs to upload information to a site.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,739
This site is typically registered anonymously.

6
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,570
Adaware uses domains.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,295
They are not associated with legitimate businesses.

8
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:24,100
Therefore, these domains are disposable.
