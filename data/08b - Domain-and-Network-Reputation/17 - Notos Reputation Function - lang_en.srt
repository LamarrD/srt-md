1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,210
Now, let's discuss how Notos computes reputation of a domain.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,495
First, Notos needs to chain a repetition function,

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:10,980
given a set of domains known to be legitimate or malicious.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,050
Notos extract features for each of these domains and give label 1 to malicious domains,

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,275
and label 0 to legitimate domains.

6
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,295
Then, given this training data set,

7
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:24,900
Notos can use a machine learning algorithm to learn a function that,

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,540
given the Notos feature vector of a domain,

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,780
it will output a label,

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,245
meaning 0 or 1,

11
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:35,145
and the reputation score of this domain is simply the confidence of this label.

12
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:38,545
That is, the probability that this domain is malicious.

13
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:40,185
As we can see here,

14
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:41,810
this function is very accurate.

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,365
That is, it has a very high true positive array and very low false positive rate.

16
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:49,100
Here, we show that Notos can detect

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,825
many malicious domains days or weeks before they show up in any blacklist.

18
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:58,100
Sometimes that's even months before they show up in any blacklist.

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,620
This is true for all the malicious domains

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,810
and also for different types of malicious domains
