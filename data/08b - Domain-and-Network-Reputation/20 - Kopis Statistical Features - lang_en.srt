1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Now, let's take a look at Kopis.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,140
Recall that Kopis is similar to Notos except that

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,000
Kopis is deployed at the upper level of the DNS hierarchy.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,310
Therefore, the main difference between Kopis and Notos is in their features.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,435
In particular, Kopis analyzes requester diversity.

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,680
This requester diversity features characterize if the machines that

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,580
query a given domain name are localized or are globally distributed.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,595
The requester profile features distinguish request from a small network

9
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:34,665
versus a large network because

10
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:38,010
a larger network would have a larger number of infected machines.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,130
The resolved IP reputation futures look at whether the IP address space pointed

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:49,060
to by a given domain name has been historically linked with known malicious activities.
