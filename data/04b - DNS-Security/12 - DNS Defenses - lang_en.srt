1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,550
So what are the defenses
against cache poisoning attack?

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,360
The first few here simply make
the attackers do a lot more work

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,720
in order to succeed.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,680
For example we can increase
the query ID size,

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,590
we can randomize the source port or
we can query twice.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,450
More fundamentally, we can use
cryptography to provide authenticity

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,740
of DNS records, and
that's the idea behind DNSSEC.
