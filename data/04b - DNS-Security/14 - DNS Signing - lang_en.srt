00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,959
Here's an example of
the DNS signing process.

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:06,710
Suppose a local DNS server
looks up wikipedia.org.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,690
They first query the root server.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,720
The root server provides the IP
address of .org and signs it.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,239
The signature is based on
private key of the root server.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,830
The DNS server performs recursive query,

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,520
in this case sending
the request to .org.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,400
And the response contains the IP
address of wikipedia.org signed

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,330
with the public key of .org.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,480
The local DNS server can modify
all these signatures and

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,730
be confident that the IP address
that it receives is correct.
