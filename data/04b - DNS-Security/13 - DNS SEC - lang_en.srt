00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,260
So let's discuss the DNSSEC.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,660
The goals of DNSSEC is to provide
guarantees of the authenticity

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,690
of the DNS servers as well as
the integrity of their responses.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,330
These guarantees are accomplished by
having the DNS servers sign responses

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,670
every step of the way.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,030
It is also assumed that the DNS
servers themselves can be secured.
