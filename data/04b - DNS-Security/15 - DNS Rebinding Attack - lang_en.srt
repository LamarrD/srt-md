1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,870
Even DNS-SEC cannot
prevent all DNS attacks.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,050
The DNS Rebinding Attack
is one such example.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,030
To among a DNS rebinding attack,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,240
the attacker needs only register
a domain name, such as evil.com.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,060
And attract web traffic, for example,
by running an advertisement in a frame.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,824
In this attack, when evil.com is
looked up, the attacker answers with

7
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:26,902
the IP address of his own server and
use a very short TTL value.

8
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,932
The attacker's server, evil.com,

9
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:32,189
also serves the browser
a malicious JavaScript.

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,720
To circumvent the firewall,

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,980
when the malicious JavaScript issues a
query to evil.com, the TTL has expired.

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,780
The attacker then rebinds the host name,
evil.com,

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,480
to an IP address of an internal server.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,500
That is, now the firewall thinks
that evil.com is internal.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,530
The browser now believes that these
two servers belong to the same origin,

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,210
because they share the same host name,
www.evil.com.

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,360
So it will allows script
to read back the response.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,290
Therefore, the malicious script
can easily extra trade information

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,420
from the server to evil.com.

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,070
That is now the attacker is able
to read arbitrary documents

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,460
from the internal server.

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,240
To mitigate such attack,
the browser should use DNS Pinning.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,600
Meaning that, you should refuse the
switching to new IP address for domain.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,870
On the other hand,
this means that it may break proxies,

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,430
VPNs, dynamic DNS and so on.

26
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,260
Therefore, it is not consistently
implemented in all browsers.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,980
For the internal servers,
they should check Host headers for

28
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,910
unrecognized domains such as evil.com.

29
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,210
It should also provide stronger
authentication of users.

30
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,740
For the firewall is
to implement a policy

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,600
such that external domain names cannot
resolve to internal IP address.

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,030
It should provide stronger protection
of browsers within the network.
