1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,620
Now let's talk about
underground economy.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,820
To understand the underground
economy of server crimes

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,910
we have to first understand who
are the actors in the underground.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,600
The first are the ones
who write exploits.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,750
They discover bugs that can be exploited
to cause security to be compromised and

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,010
they sell them for a profit.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,660
Then there are the botnet masters,
or bad guys that create and

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,430
operate a malicious network
composed of compromised computers.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,060
Essentially, they buy exploits and
turn them into malware and

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,380
they put in the botnet command and
control components.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,860
So when they release the malware,
they have a botnet under their control.

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,277
Then they rent out the botnet
to other bad actors for

13
00:00:45,277 --> 00:00:47,990
malicious and fraudulent activities.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,442
One of the utilities of
a botnet is to send spam.

15
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:56,636
And so the bot master of a botnet can
simply rent out his botnet to a spammer,

16
00:00:56,636 --> 00:01:02,720
and the spammer in turn sends out a spam
contents on behalf of other bad actors.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,160
One type of bad actors that can use
to help of spammers are the phishers.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,487
They set up scam sites
to steal information and

19
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:17,710
they ask the spammers to send the URL's
to victim users to the scam sites.

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,070
Similarly, counterfeiters use spams
to sell their counterfeit goods and

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,440
obviously, they need to be able to
collect money from the victim users.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,192
For example, from their credit cards.

23
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:35,110
A bad actor in a cyberspace needs
to consider the possibility that

24
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,540
his operation, in particular his
websites, may be detected and

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,250
shut down by the law enforcement.

26
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,900
And so he needs to find a so-called
bulletproof hosting providers.

27
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,330
These providers typically operate in
lawless places and they are expensive.

28
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,650
A majority of the bad actors
are in it for the money.

29
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,100
And on the Internet, what they can steal
are the bank accounts and credit cards.

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,860
And so they need to turn them into cash.

31
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,580
They allow carders, cashiers,
and mules to do just that.

32
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,260
The crowdturfers leverage human powered
crowd sourcing platforms to create and

33
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,250
manage fake accounts that
are not tired to real users.

34
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,390
And they can use crowd
sourcing to solve captures.
