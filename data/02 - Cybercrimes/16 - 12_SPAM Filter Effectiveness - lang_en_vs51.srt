00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,370
Let's discuss a case
study on Storm botnet.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,980
This botnet was used to send spams.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,030
And this research was performed by the
University of California in San Diego,

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,390
where the researchers penetrated
into the Storm botnet.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,790
The researchers were able to
measure the percentage of spam

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,870
that got through the spam filters.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,220
Here are different campaigns
carried out by the spams.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,860
Pharmacy is a spam advertising
an online pharmacy.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,650
The postcard and April Fool campaigns
are for installing malware.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,870
As we can see here from data that's
available, there are spam filters

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,850
that can actually filter out more
than 99% of the spam messages.

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,850
On average, only 0.014% of
the spam messages that can get

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,430
through the filters, which translates
into 1 in more than 7,000.

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,060
Looking at the whole lifecycle of
a spam message, some get not delivered,

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,570
some get blocked by spam filters,
some are ignored by the users, and

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,587
users may just leave the sites.

17
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:02,940
Of course, some of them will
actually commit a transaction.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,422
But some of these traffics
are due to crawlers,

19
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:08,310
meaning that they're not actual users.

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,645
This table shows that for each campaign,

21
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,970
what's the percentage of
spams that can be delivered,

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,940
filtered, result in user visiting
the website, and user conversion.

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,220
Obviously, user conversion is
the most interesting number

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,580
that we should look at.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,929
For pharmacy, it's 1 in 1,737.

26
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:29,539
For postcard, it's 1 in 37.

27
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,164
For April Fool, it's 1 in 25.

28
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:38,910
This conversion rate is computed for the
spams that got into the user's inbox.

29
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,570
How many of them result
in user transactions?

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,010
The pharmacy campaign advertise
a fake online pharmacy.

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,647
The researchers observed that there
were 28 purchases in 26 days.

32
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:55,235
The average price per purchase is $100.

33
00:01:55,235 --> 00:02:00,860
But the researchers only controlled
1.5% of the bots sending the spams.

34
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,970
If we extrapolate this amount
to the whole botnet population,

35
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:12,380
then we get close to $9500 a day,
or $3.5 million a year.

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,200
Of course, the scammer and
spammer will divvy up this money.

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,480
So the Storm operators or the spammers
will get $1.7 million a year.
