1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,130
With the example storm botnets,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,730
you may think that making money
is easy in the underground.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,540
Actually, it is not easy.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,960
In fact, scamming is supported by
a whole ecosystem that includes

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,450
network infrastructure and
payment system.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,770
For example, we're going to
start the pharmaceutical scams.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,240
Suppose you want to set up a website
called canadianpharma.com.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,730
The question is that how do you do this?

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,900
What sort of infrastructure do you need?

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,750
Because obviously you should worry
about law enforcement agencies

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,780
shutting down your website.

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,460
Even before that, you should worry
about that legitimate registers

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,400
may not even let you
register your domain name.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,030
So you go to the shady registrars,
but they would charge you more.

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,730
After you obtain your domain,

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,450
you want a DNS server that map
the domain name into an IP address.

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,470
Some DNS providers will shut down
your domain if they hear complaints.

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,330
So you go to the so-called
bulletproof DNS providers,

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,790
that operates in lawless land,
but they are expensive.

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,360
Now to set up your website,
you need to stand up a web server.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,260
For example, a machine in ISP.

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,930
But, the ISP or law enforcement
can shut down your website.

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,150
So, you want to go to
the bulletproof network providers.

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,120
Again, they're expensive.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,640
There are indeed service providers that
offer very low priced, resilient hosting

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,900
services, but obviously they
are very expensive after you set up

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,560
the network infrastructure, now you need
to consider how do you receive payments.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,250
Basically you need to handle
credit card payments and

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,580
get money out of these accounts.

30
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,800
The trouble is that most banks and

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,380
credit card processors won't
do business with scammers.

32
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,790
Again your solution is to go to a few
banks in some lawless countries

33
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,610
to handle your payment.

34
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,460
To be successful in scamming,

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,130
you almost have to learn it
like a legitimate business.

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,290
For example, you should ship
products to customers, why?

37
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,920
Because if the customers are not happy,
they will complain and

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,330
the processors and
banks will shut down your accounts.
