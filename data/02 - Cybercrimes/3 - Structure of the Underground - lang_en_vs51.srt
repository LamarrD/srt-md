00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,290
As we have discussed, there are quite a
few types of bad actors in a cyber space

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,240
and they form
an interconnected ecosystem.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,470
For example, a botnet is created
when computers are compromised,

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,370
a malware is installed and

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,160
a botnet is used to launch a number of
malicious and fraudulent activities.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,450
For example these are activities
that can be launched by botnet,

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,350
in particular spam.

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,730
Spam can be used to facilitate a number
of other activities such as phishing,

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,970
selling counterfeit goods or
malware installation.

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,265
Again, the point here is that the bad
actors form an interconnected

11
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:43,770
ecosystem because their activities or
even structures support each other.
