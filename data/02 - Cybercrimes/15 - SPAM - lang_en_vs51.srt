1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,830
It is estimated that more than 90%
of our email are actually spam.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,210
That will translate into hundreds of
billions of spam messages every day.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,250
Spammers play a very key role in
the underground economy and cybercrime.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,690
They have contacts of many many
people and many organizations.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,340
They send messages on
behalf of other bad actors.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,180
They can be used to push malware or
phish to steal information.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,870
Spammers typically use
botnets to send spam.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,200
They need a large number of IP addresses
because otherwise, sending a large

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,910
number of emails from a few IP addresses
will easily trigger detection and

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,100
blocking by spam filters.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,010
Let's start via few examples of how
spam works in the underground economy.

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,160
Many spammers are affiliates of
various kinds of scam campaigns.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,540
Scammers typically set up websites
to sell counterfeit goods.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,650
The scammers try to act legitimately
by delivering goods and

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,050
collecting payments.

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,460
They can even have customer services.

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,500
But how do the scam
websites attract traffic?

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,010
They need the spammers to advertise for
them.

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,070
And in return,
the spammers collect commissions.

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,810
For example,

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,170
the commission can be as high as 30
to 50% of the final sales price.

22
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,170
Now the key to the success
of both the scammers and

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,450
the spammers is the spam
conversion rate.

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,970
The spam conversion rate is
the percentage of spam messages

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,950
that result in a final sale.

26
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,540
We know that there
are spam filters around.

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,880
And we have the feeling that
a lot of them are very effective.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,660
So why do spammers
continue to send spam?

29
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,850
And how many messages
get past spam filters?

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,510
We heard numbers such as more than
99% of the spams are filtered.

31
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,350
Any spam leads to
a successful transaction.

32
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,245
How much money can be made?

33
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:55,640
The only way to precisely answer
these questions is to infiltrate and

34
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,695
instrument the spam generation and
monetization process.

35
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:03,145
Because by doing so
we can find out exactly what's going on.
