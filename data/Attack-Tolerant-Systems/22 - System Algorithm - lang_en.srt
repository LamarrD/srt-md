00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
So here is a sketch of how a client can get service from this system.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,675
A client sends a request to invoke a service operation to the primary service replica.

3
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:14,190
The primary multicasts the request to the backups,

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,160
meaning the group of replicas.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,040
The replicas execute the request and send a reply to the client.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,590
The client waits for f plus one replies from different replicas with the same result,

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,000
and that is the result of the operation.
