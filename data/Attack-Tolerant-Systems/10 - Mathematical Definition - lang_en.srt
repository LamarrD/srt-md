00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Now, let's discuss the math behind secure sharing.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,050
The goal of secure sharing is that for some secret data say D,

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,255
we divide the data into n pieces,

4
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:11,110
D1, D2, through Dn.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,810
In such a way that, if you know k or more pieces of D,

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,105
then you can compute D. On the other hand,

7
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:20,520
if you know only k minus one of fewer pieces of D,

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,515
then you can not determine D. The best you can do is a random guess.

9
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:27,820
This is the so-called k, n threshold scheme.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,925
If k equal to n, that means

11
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:33,850
all participants are required together to reconstruct the secret.
