00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
When we say an asynchronous system achieve fault-tolerance,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,550
we typically mean that,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,465
it has both safety and liveness.

4
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:13,020
Safety means that, even if the system fails, nothing series happens.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,420
Liveliness means that, the kinds of

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,360
the system can eventually receive replies to their requests.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,400
In order for an asynchronous system to provide safety and liveness,

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,240
it needs to have a minimum 3f plus one replicas.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,775
Here, f is the maximum number of faulty replicas.

10
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,890
We need 3f plus one replicas,

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,910
it must be possible to proceed after communicating with n minus one replicas,

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,835
since f replicas might be faulty and not responding.

13
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:47,800
However, it is possible that the f replicas that did not respond are not faulty,

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,505
and therefore f of those that respond, might be faulty.

15
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:54,660
Even so, there must be enough responses,

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,945
that those from non-faulty replicas out number those from faulty ones,

17
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:03,505
that is, n minus two f is greater than f. Therefore,

18
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,780
n has to be greater than 3f.
