00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
The Byzantine generals problem is an example of asynchronous distributed system.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,250
In such systems, we typically assume that the network is not reliable.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,725
That is, there's no guarantee for reliable communications.

4
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:17,264
Furthermore, a faulty node may behave arbitrarily.

5
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:20,100
That means, its behavior is not defined.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,725
Also, the nodes fail independently.

7
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:26,900
That means, there's no correlation of failures among the nodes.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,090
On the other hand, we also assume that the attackers

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,070
cannot indefinitely block a node from providing service,

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,620
and the attacker cannot break crypto.
