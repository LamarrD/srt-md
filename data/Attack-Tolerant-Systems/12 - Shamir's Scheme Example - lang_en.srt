1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,305
Here's an example. Suppose k equal to two.

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:06,595
That is, the polynomial is a linear function, a line.

3
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:09,895
Suppose all you know is one point, say S1.

4
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:12,675
You cannot determine the polynomial because there are

5
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:15,460
infinite number of lines that go through S1.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,860
It is clear that you need two points to determine a line.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,875
For example, if you know both S1 and S2,

8
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:25,330
then you can reconstruct the line and then you can compute S,

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,205
which is the original secret.

10
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:30,925
Notice that, this example also shows that obviously,

11
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:34,610
any two points on a line can determine the same line,

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,400
which means any two of the entries can help you

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,790
reconstruct the original secret S. In general,

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,530
when we need to determine q(X),

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,790
we should use the Lagrange interpolation algorithm.
