1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,375
Now let's discuss how do we make system services tolerate attacks.

2
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:09,090
First, we will discuss a related area called fault tolerance.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,665
A fault in the system is the cost of an error that leads to a system failure.

4
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:17,095
Again, a system error is because of a fault,

5
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:19,250
and error leads to a failure.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,870
Fault tolerance can be achieved through a failure masking.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,435
And failure masking can be achieved through redundancy.

8
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:29,270
For example, let's look at a example system.

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,705
Here, a single fault in any of these three components can lead to a failure.

10
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:37,990
An example of redundancy is triple modular redundancy.

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,295
We can put motors at each stage of the system.

12
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:46,470
And each voter accepts the majority as the correct output from the components.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,430
This scheme can mask any single failure of the components.
