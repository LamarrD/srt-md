00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
Now let's discuss a threshold secret sharing scheme by Shamir.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,620
Shamir is the S in RSA and in 1979,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,185
he invented a (k,n) threshold scheme.

4
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:12,855
Here's how Shamir's secret sharing scheme works.

5
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:15,544
We choose a random k-1 coefficients;

6
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:18,530
a1, a2, a3 through a_k1.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,005
We let the secret S be a0.

8
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:26,675
In other words, we pick a random k-1 degree polynomial and we represent it as this.

9
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:29,530
Again, a0 is a secret S,

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,450
and a1, a2 through a_k-1 are randomly chosen.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,160
Then we construct n points on this polynomial.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,080
That is, for i=1,

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,495
2 all the way through n,

14
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:41,070
we compute q of i.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,435
Then we construct n points of the polynomial q(x).

16
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:46,710
That is, for i=1, 2,

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,805
all the way through n, we compute Si equal to q of i.

18
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:52,845
For example, if i=1,

19
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,195
we set x=1 for q(x).

20
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:58,330
This Si's are essentially the shares of S.

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,090
All arithmetic operations are done modulo a prime number p,

22
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,095
and p is greater than S and n. Again,

23
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:07,230
the coefficients a1, a2,

24
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:12,320
through a_k-1 are randomly chosen from a uniform distribution over the integers in

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,600
the range of 0 and p. Given any subset of k of these pairs or points,

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,805
we can find the coefficients of the polynomial q(x) by interpolation.

27
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:24,155
Of course, once we find the coefficients,

28
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:26,600
we have determined the polynomial q(x).

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,380
This is guaranteed by the mathematical property that any k points

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,430
can uniquely determine a polynomial of degree k-1.

31
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,095
Once q(x) is determined,

32
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,650
then we set x equal to 0 and compute q(0),

33
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,210
that will give us a0,

34
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,735
which is the original secret S. In other words,

35
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:47,125
with this scheme given any K shares,

36
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,950
we can reconstruct the secret.
