The major weakness of

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,120
this naive secret sharing scheme is that the more shares you have of the secret,

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,835
the less work you have to do to guess the secret.

00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:13,480
In a secure scheme, it should not matter how many shares of a secret a party has.

You should take the same amount of guess work as a party with no shares.
