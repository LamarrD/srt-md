1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
One approach is by secret sharing.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,655
Cryptographic secret sharing involves,

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:06,780
giving each party a share of a secret,

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,780
the secret can only be reconstructed if all parties participate and share their portion.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,465
For example, if the secret is a password.

6
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:17,975
That is P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D!

7
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:20,820
we can break the secret into shares,

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,145
and give the shares to three different parties.

9
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:27,105
That is, now each of these three parties has a share of the secret.

10
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:31,330
Now, I'm going to ask you what's wrong with this scheme, I'll give you a hint.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,530
If the attacker knows the password has nine characters,

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,190
how many possible combinations will have to be checked?

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,420
What if the attacker doing the guessing,

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,080
knew one share of the secret.
