1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
We have networks with valuable data on them.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,690
These networks have been attacked or will be attacked.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,620
We can do everything humanly possible to stop attacks,

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,630
but we also need to build systems that can withstand attacks.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,550
In this lesson, we learned about attack tolerant systems.
