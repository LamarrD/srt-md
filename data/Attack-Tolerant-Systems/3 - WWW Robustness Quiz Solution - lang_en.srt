1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
The internet is a scale-free network.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,760
We can infer that it has a high degree of tolerance

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,220
towards random failure and a low degree of tolerance against attacks.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,960
The most successful attacks target the nodes that are the most connected.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,830
When a highly connected node is attacked,

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,275
the internet begins to fracture and splinter into unconnected networks.

7
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:26,540
It is this characteristic of the internet that makes attacks so successful.
