00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,055
Getting a set of non-faulty services to reach consensus is actually quite challenging.

2
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:07,385
Let's use an example to illustrate.

3
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:10,260
The Byzantine Generals Problem refers to

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,310
a hypothetical situation in which a group of generals,

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,860
each commanding a portion of an army plan to attack a city.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,160
The generals must decide to attack or wait.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,779
Every General must agree on a common decision,

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,020
anything less will result in a defeat.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,380
The problem is compounded by the fact that there may be

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,540
traitorous generals that do not vote for the best strategy.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,195
Of course, there can be disagreement among the generals.

12
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:41,005
For example, some would vote for attack,

13
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,155
while others will go for wait.

14
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:46,830
As you can see, it's not easy to reach consensus.
