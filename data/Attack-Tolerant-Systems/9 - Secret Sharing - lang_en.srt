1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,955
Again, in cryptography, a secret sharing scheme

2
00:00:02,955 --> 00:00:06,270
distributes the secret among a group of participants,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,630
so that each of the participant has a share of the secret.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,395
The share can only be reconstructed when the shares are combined together.

5
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:17,295
Most importantly, individual shares are of no use on their own.

6
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:18,470
We secure sharing.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,030
We can give a tighter control and remove

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,840
any single point of vulnerability with regard to confidentiality.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,920
This is because even if an attacker has compromised an individual

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,090
key shareholder he still cannot change or access to data.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,360
And of course we can also improve integrity and

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,190
availability by replicating each share among the group.
