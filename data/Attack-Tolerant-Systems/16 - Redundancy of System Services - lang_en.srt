00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,115
In a previous example of a redundant system,

2
00:00:03,115 --> 00:00:06,860
we see that the motor takes the majority as the correct output.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,330
This assumes that the non-faulty components can reach a consensus.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,610
Therefore, the goal of a redundant system is

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,800
that a set of non-faulty services can reach a consensus,

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,785
even in the presence of some corrupted or faulty services.

7
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:27,610
This consensus is then the correct service that a system will provide.
