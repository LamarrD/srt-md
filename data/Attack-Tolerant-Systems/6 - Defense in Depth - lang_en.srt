1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,590
We all know the principle of defense in depth.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,440
That is, the first layer of defense is prevention.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,140
The second layer is detection,

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,640
and the third layer is about surviving the attack.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,765
The best way to survive an attack is to able to tolerate the attack.

6
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:18,900
That is, an attack will not be able to render our network or system ineffective.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,250
When we say our network and systems should tolerate an attack,

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,230
we mean that our data and our services should tolerate the attacks.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,940
For our data, we want the confidentiality,

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,955
integrity, and availability to remain intact.

11
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,325
For our system services,

12
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:38,000
we want the availability and integrity to remain intact.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,115
Let's first look at how to make our data tolerate an attack.

14
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,940
Typically, data is stored in one place,

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,770
for example, a dedicated server.

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,875
So, all the attacker needs to do is to compromise that data storage server.

17
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,105
That is, if the attacker can compromise the data storage server,

18
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:55,235
then the confidentiality, integrity,

19
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:57,670
and availability of data are all compromised.

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,065
Now, what if we replicate the data and store the copies in multiple,

21
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,775
say n different servers,

22
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:05,825
would this scheme improve security?

23
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:10,280
That is, would this scheme make our data more tolerant towards attacks?

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,045
For confidentiality protection, this is actually a weaker scheme

25
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:18,300
because the attacker can get data from any of these n servers.

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,935
That is, the attacker now has more opportunities.

27
00:01:20,935 --> 00:01:23,870
Whereas, if we use a majority voting scheme,

28
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,710
then integrity and availability are better protected because

29
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,015
now the attacker needs to compromise the majority of these n servers.

30
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:33,965
So, now the question is, for our data,

31
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:36,200
can we have a better confidentiality protection?
