1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,245
Let's use an example to illustrate.

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:05,415
Suppose k is three and n is five.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:10,065
Further, the ultra secret is seven and a0 is seven,

4
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:15,485
a1 is three and a2 is five and the modular prime number p is 11.

5
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:21,490
That is; qx is 5x squared plus 3x plus seven modular 11.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,130
Since n is five,

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,165
we compute five shares of five points by setting x to be one,

8
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:30,945
two, three, four, and five,

9
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:32,740
and these are the shares.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,395
Since k is three with three shares,

11
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:37,600
we should be able to reconstruct the secret.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,595
Say we have three shares S1, S2, and S5.

13
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:45,710
Then we can use this formula due to Lagrange to compute qx.

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,895
So, we can plug in these points to the formula that is setting the x,

15
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:51,665
i or j's to be one,

16
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:53,570
two and five and setting the y,

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,075
i's to be four, zero, and four.

18
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:59,110
Then we have qx represented as this formula.

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:06,065
With simple arithmetic, you can verify that qx is five x squared plus 3x plus seven.

20
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:10,385
Then we set x to zero and q of zero is seven

21
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:15,740
which is the original secret and this is how we use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme.
