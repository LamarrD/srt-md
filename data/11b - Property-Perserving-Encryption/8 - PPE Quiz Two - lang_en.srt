00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,030
Now letâ€™s take a look at another example
of property-preserving encryption.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,160
Again, we want to encrypt
the age information.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,420
And this time, we preserve the order.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,540
As we can see,

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,420
in the encrypted data, the order of
the original values is preserved.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,880
The question is, what is leaked
in order-preserving encryption?
