1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,859
The previous examples are simple.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:05,140
Now the question is, what does
the leakage in property preserving

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,250
encryption really mean for
real applications?

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,520
We can take a look at
the electronic medical records.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,560
Here are some attributes in
electronic medical records.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,320
These attributes are typically used
in equality queries or ordering.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,060
In other words, to ensure that
the applications will continue to work,

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,690
these attributes will be encrypted
to preserve equality or order.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,280
These attributes are sensitive to either
the hospital or the patient or both.
