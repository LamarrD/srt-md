00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's discuss data privacy
issues in a cloud environment.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,290
First let's review how
data breaches happen.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,840
In a cloud environment
the users use applications or

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,900
data stored in a cloud provider.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,470
For example,
the users can be doctors and nurses, and

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,230
the application can be the electronic
medical record system.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,200
And the data obviously
is the medical records.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,970
And the called EMR here can be
a private called such as UCLA Health.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,770
As another example,
the users can be average consumers.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,000
And the application can online dating.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,740
And of course,
the data can be the dating profiles.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,050
In most cases, including
the examples that we just discuss,

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,290
data is the most valuable
target to the attacker.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,870
For example,
the attacker may want to steal the data.

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,700
Now the question is,
how do we protect the data?

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,320
Obviously we can encrypt the data.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,100
For example,

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,920
the users can have their own secret
encryption key for their data.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,180
And once the data is encrypted the
adversary can no longer read the data.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,650
The problem when the data is
encrypted the applications

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,250
can no longer use the data as it is.

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,000
For example if the application
is a word processing programm

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,460
such as Microsoft Word, it cannot
process encrypted data directly.

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,610
Therefore, the real question
is can we protect the data

25
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,070
while we also let the application work?

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,890
In other words, we want to protect
the data by encrypting the data, so

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,100
that the adversary cannot read our data.

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,570
On the other hand, we also want
the application to continue to work.
