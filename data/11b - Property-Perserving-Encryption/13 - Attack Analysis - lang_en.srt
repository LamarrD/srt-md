00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,040
Lets use an example to illustrate
frequency analysis attack.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,810
Here is encrypted data of the number
of days a patient stays in hospital.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,890
As you can see the data is encrypted
to perform frequency analysis

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,590
we first sort the data and
record the frequency.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,440
We also sort and record
the frequency of the auxiliary data.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,310
For example, there's public information
of how frequent a patient will stay for

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,990
one day versus two days and so on.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,070
By matching these two histograms
we can link a cyber text value

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,440
to a plain text value.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,710
For example, for the first cyber
attack value the frequency is ten.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,030
And we know that from
the auxiliary data,

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,940
the plain text value one
has frequency of 11.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,240
Therefore, we can link the ciphertext
value to plaintext value one.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,670
And therefore, with frequency analysis,

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,440
we can uncover the plaintext
data without the encryption key.
