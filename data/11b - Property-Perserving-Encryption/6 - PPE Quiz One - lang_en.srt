00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,980
To understand the potential
security issues of

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,970
Property Preserving Encryption,
let's do a quiz.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,490
First, let's review standard encryption.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,870
In standard encryption,
there is no preserving of properties.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,460
For example,
suppose we encrypt the age information.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,690
The encrypted data leaks
nothing except the size

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,400
of the original plain text data.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,160
For example,
we know that there are four entries.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,120
Now let's take a look at an example
of property preserving encryption.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,270
Again, we want to encrypt the age
information, but we preserve equality.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,870
Therefore in encrypted data, we see
that these two values are the same,

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,740
because the original paying
tax values are the same.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,060
So what is preserved?
