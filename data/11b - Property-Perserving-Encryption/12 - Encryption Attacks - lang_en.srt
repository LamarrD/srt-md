1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,855
Recall that these attributes
are encrypted using either

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:06,500
Equality-Preserving Encryption or
Order-Preserving Encryption.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,225
An attacker can use
frequency analysis to defeat

4
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:11,090
Equality-Preserving Encryption.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,120
And this attack can
be further optimized.
