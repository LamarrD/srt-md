1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,300
This attack can be generalized and
optimized.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,210
Again, start with the encrypted data,
we have obtained a frequency histogram.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,080
We also obtain a frequency
histogram from the auxiliary data.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,020
The basic idea is then,
to find an assignment from servertext

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,080
to plaintext that minimizes
a gives cost function.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,910
Here the cost function is
the distance between the histograms.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,850
This has the effect of minimizing
the total mismatch in frequencies across

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,980
all plaintext- ciphertext pairs.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,360
For example, for this assignment,
the cost is this.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,440
Whereas the assignment on mapping,
it has the minimum cost is this.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,620
There's an algorithm that can find the
assignments that has the minimum cost.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,350
With this algorithm,
we can find the assignment

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,760
from ciphertext to plain text and then
decipher the original encrypted data.
