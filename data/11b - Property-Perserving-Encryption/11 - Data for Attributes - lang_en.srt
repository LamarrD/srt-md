1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,640
The data as we can obtain from
the hospitals is encrypted.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,100
On the other hand, there's information,
or auxiliary data that is public.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,860
We will show that using both
the encrypted data and auxiliary data,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,500
an attacker can launch inference
attack to obtain plaintext data.
